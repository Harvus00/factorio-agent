It is a passive\nstorage\n— it has no input and no output, essentially acting as volume increase of the\npipe\nsegment it is connected to.\nContents\n1\nUsage\n2\nUsage as \"Energy-tank\"\n2.1\nCalculations\n3\nGallery\n4\nHistory\n5\nSee also\nUsage\nThe storage tank is often used to store raw materials and excess products from\noil processing\n, allowing a\nrefinery\nto run without interruptions. It can be used as short term buffer to keep up throughput for high volume recipes such as\nacid neutralisation\nand\nsteam condensation\nto avoid the machines getting full or empty. It can also be connected to the\ncircuit network\n, sending the fluid contents as a signal to the network.\nStorage tanks are part of the fluid segment they are connected to, so they are always filled to the same percentage of capacity as the pipes that lead to it. As there is no real flow in the pipes, a storage tank is always filled evenly with the segment it is connected to, regardless of how far away an inflow is. If there are multiple storage tanks connected to the same pipe segment, they all have exactly the same fill state.\nThe fluid inside the storage tank can be destroyed by flushing the storage tank or the whole fluid system in the GUI, or by mining and rebuilding the storage tank. The storage tank can be emptied without destroying the contained fluid by draining it with a\npump\n. Mining a storage tank will send its contents to the next nearest storage tanks, if the fluids match.\nUsage as \"Energy-tank\"\nSee also:\nSteam tanks as power storage\nStorage tanks can also be used as a replacement for\naccumulators\n. If steam consumption by\nsteam engines\nor\nturbines\nchanges a lot over a daily cycle (for example due to\nsolar panels\nor\nlaser turrets\n), storage tanks can be filled with steam during low power usage and then emptied during heavy load.\nA storage tank filled with\nheat exchanger\n500°C steam stores around 2.4GJ; a storage tank filled with\nboiler\n165°C steam stores 750MJ.\nCalculations\n1\nStorage tank\ncan store 25,000 units of 500ºC steam.\n1\nSteam turbine\ncan output 5,820kW = 5,820kJ/s using 60 units of 500ºC steam/s.\n1 Storage tank can keep 1 steam turbine working at full capacity for 25,000 ∕ 60 ≈ 416.6667s\nA Storage tank can store up to 25,000 ∕ 60 × 5,820 =\n2,425,000kJ\nusing 500ºC steam.\n1\nStorage tank\ncan store 25,000 units of 165ºC steam.\n1\nSteam engine\ncan output 900kW = 900kJ/s using 30 units of 165ºC steam/s.\n1 Storage tank can keep 1 steam engine working for 25,000 ∕ 30 ≈ 833.3333s\nA Storage tank can store up to 25,000 ∕ 30 × 900 =\n750,000kJ\nusing 165ºC steam.\nThe storage tank's GUI with the ability to clear the contained fluid.\nFour storage tanks linked together to form a large storage facility.\n0.15.7\n:\nReduced the mining time of the storage tank from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds.\n0.15.0\n:\nMultiplied all fluid amounts by 10.\n0.13.12\n:\nFluid icon now scales with size of tank.\n0.12.0\n:\nLiquid inside can be seen through a small window.\nNow connectible to the\ncircuit network\n.\n0.9.1\n:\nStorage tank has 2.5 times bigger capacity (25000 litres) and takes longer to mine.\n0.9.0\n:\nIntroduced\nFluid system\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Storage_tank&oldid=210561\n\"",

It is powered by burning\nfuel\n, compared to the more advanced inserters which are powered by\nelectricity\n. It will add fuel to its own supply if it picks any up, which makes it useful for filling\nboilers\nwith\ncoal\n. This has the advantage that it will continue working even if the power fails, as opposed to electrically-powered inserters which will be unable to function. It consumes no fuel while idle, though it consumes vastly more energy than most other inserters when active.\nEven though it doesn't use electricity, a burner inserter can be connected to and controlled by the\nlogistic\nand the\ncircuit network\n.\nFuel consumption\nA burner inserter consumes no power while idle and does not continuously consume the maximum amount of power when working. Burner Inserters spawn with an internal energy buffer of 500 kJ, represented as 25% the value of a piece of wood fuel (which is 2MJ). Aside from not having drain, all its other power characteristics are identical to the rest of the inserters. It simply pulls its joules from its fuel rather than your power grid. For more detailed information on inserter power characteristics you can reference the main page\nhere\n.\nBurners also have a behavior known as \"leeching\" where they will pull fuel from their input and commandeer it for their own use. This leeching behavior is not exactly quantified, but it is triggered whenever the internal fuel inventory reaches zero, and performing the action also consumes fuel since motion is never free.\n2.0.7\n:\nAll inserters now have filter option.\nEnergy consumption increased from 94.2 kW to 144 kW.\nBurner inserters now reliably pick up items off of\nfast transport belts\nand\nexpress transport belts\n.\n0.13.2\n:\nInserters connected to the circuit network now have the option to only read hand contents.\n0.13.0\n:\nInserters can now send the item held in hand to the circuit network.\nInserters are able to squeeze things\nslightly\nbetter to belts.\nAll types of inserters can be controlled by the circuit and logistic network, once the respective network is researched.\n0.12.16\n:\nImproved burner inserter's fuel searching logic; it will now search both transport belt lines for fuel\n0.12.11\n:\nBurner inserter now grabs fuel for itself even if the target doesn't need it\n0.12.2\n:\nInserters will never take more than the max stack size of an item.\nInserters and logistic robots no longer extract from enemy chests\nInserters now correctly pick up items from splitters\n0.12.1\n:\nBurner inserters start with enough energy to pick up 1 item and fuel themselves.\n0.12.0\n:\nInserters can now extract from roboports and beacons.\nInserters now take items from right behind them, not from the center of the pickup target entity.\n0.10.0\n:\nNew icon\nNew sounds\n0.9.2\n:\nInserters can have arbitrary pickup and insert positions.\n0.9.0\n:\nInserter code optimisation, inserters that have nothing to do will sleep.\n0.8.0\n:\nImproved inserter's ability to pull from train wagons.\n0.7.1\n:\nFast inserter now has the same speed as the smart inserter.\n0.5.0\n:\nInserter can now pick up up to 5 items when researched.\n0.4.0\n:\nSmaller inserter bounding box\n0.3.0\n:\nNew Inserter graphics\n0.2.1\n:\nThe item in the hand of the inserter is returned to the player when mined.\n0.2.0\n:\nShow direction of inserter\n0.1.0\n:\nIntroduced\nInserters\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Burner_inserter&oldid=213575\n\"",

The pump can be seen as the\ninserter\nfor fluids.\nWhen connected to pipes on both ends of the pump and powered, the pump will transfer fluid from the source side to the output side if it will fit. This will occur even if the input side has significantly lower fluid levels.\nFurthermore, unlike normal pipes, pumps can connect to pipes only on the front and back of the pump instead of connecting to pipes from all sides. This can be useful for having tightly packed lines of pipes being parallel to each other, without the risk of fluids mixing, acting as a \"diode\" pipe.\nParallel pumps preventing side connections.\nThroughput\nPumps can move up to 20 units of fluid per tick, or 1200 per second. Whether this throughput is actually achieved depends on the fluid level of the fluid segments upstream and downstream of the pump. If the level of the source segment is below 20%, 1200 units can no longer be achieved. The same applies if the level of the output segment is above 80%. Comprehensive information on the general behavior of fluids can be found on the page\nfluid system\n.\nLoading/unloading fluid wagons\nPumps can load and unload\nfluid wagons\nat\ntrain stops\n. When a pump is placed with one end facing a rail track and the other end connected to a pipe, it will visually change. When a fluid wagon is stopped adjacent, the pump head will connect to the top of the nearest tank and begin transferring fluids. It will not connect if a circuit condition is preventing it, or it is unpowered.\nPump transferring fluids to a fluid wagon.\nUse as a valve\nThe pump works as a controllable valve:\nWhen powered, the pump will let fluids through, but only in its set direction.\nIf unpowered, the pump doesn't let anything through.\nIf the pump is powered but has a circuit condition, it will only let fluids through when the condition is met.\nThis can be used to control some parts of a player's factory. For example, with a single wire from a\nlubricant\ntank to a pump pumping\nheavy oil\n, you can disable cracking heavy oil →\nlight oil\nwhen lubricant is needed.\nMoving fluids over long distances\nWhen a fluid is created, it can travel up to 320 tiles from it's existing location until it needs a pump. Pumps reset this value, allowing fluids to travel for another 320 tiles until another one is needed. If a pipe has been overextended, a warning will show on the map.

Like\nlocomotives\n, the color of the stops can be customized. Furthermore, the stop can be named, with\nrich text\nmaking it possible to further customize the name, such as by adding item icons.\nContents\n1\nMechanics\n2\nCircuit Network\n3\nIndicators\n4\nGallery\n5\nHistory\n6\nSee also\nMechanics\nTrain stops are used to denote a place for a train to stop. Every placed train stop will appear as a possible stop in the scheduling area of a\ntrain\n's GUI. This can be used to create loading and unloading stations for trains.\nWhen there are multiple train stops with the same name, trains will always travel to the closest stop. \"Closest\" in this case does not mean rail distance, instead the\npathfinding distance\nis used. This distance is influenced by trains on the track, in addition to rail distance, so empty train stops are preferred over occupied ones if the empty stop is not too far away.\nOpening the GUI of a stop will show the information of every train connected to that stop, including its name, current activity and location on the map. Additionally, it is possible to set a train limit for train stops via their GUI or with the circuit network. Only the set amount of trains may reserve the train stop as their destination when trying to path to it. If the train limit is lowered below the amount of trains that currently have the stop reserved as their destination, those trains will continue to go to the stop.\nTrains will attempt to avoid routes that pass through stops that are not designated as the next destination. This is represented by a penalty to the pathfinding distance, which usually forces a train to pick a \"shorter\" path.\nCircuit Network\nTrain stops can be enabled or disabled using the\ncircuit network\n. When a train stop is disabled, trains will not go to that station. If a train is scheduled to go to a stop that is disabled, it will select a stop with the same name which is enabled. If no such stops exist, the train will enter the \"destination full\" state and wait until a stop becomes enabled again. If a train is en-route or already parked at a stop when it becomes disabled, the train will continue to the stop and complete its wait conditions.\nWhen a train attempts to go to an enabled stop, it first checks to see if the stop has a \"train limit\" set. This limit specifies the maximum number of trains allowed to go to this station. If the number of trains headed to that stop (including one sitting at the stop) is greater than or equal to the stop's current train limit, then the train will not go to that stop. It will check other enabled stops with that name. If all stops with that name are full, the train will enter the \"destination full\" state. Once a stop with that name opens up to allow more trains, the train will proceed. Like disabling, if a train limit changes while a train is en-route to a stop, the train will continue to the stop and complete its wait conditions. A stop with a train limit of 0 behaves identically to a stop which has been disabled.\nWhen there are multiple valid stops with the same name, the train will next check each stop's \"priority\". Stop priority can be set manually or with the circuit network, and can be set between 0 and 255, defaulting to 50. The lowest priority is 0, and the highest priority is 255. Trains will prefer stops with a higher priority. If all valid stops have the same priority value, the train will select the closest stop. Priority values are only considered when a train is dispatched; if a train is en-route and priority values of its stop change so that it is no longer going to the highest priority stop, the train will\nnot\nre-path to the new highest priority stop and will continue on its original schedule.\nWhile a train is en-route, it may\nrepath\nto a different train stop of the same name, provided the new train stop has not reached its capacity. When this happens, the train ceases to count toward the train limit of the original stop.\nTrain stops can be used to pass circuit signals to trains, read train contents, uniquely identify trains with an ID number, or count the amount of trains going to the train stop.\nWhen reading the content of a stopped train, fluid amounts are rounded down to the nearest integer, except when the fluid amount is < 1, then it is is rounded to 1.\nIndicators\nThere are indicator lights on the top of the train stop. These show:\nSolid light – The train stop is unoccupied/available.\nAlternate blinking – A train is approaching or passing the train stop.\nSimultaneous blinking – A train is stopped/occupying the train stop.\nNo lights – The train stop is invalid.\nBlinking red – The train stop is disabled via circuit network.\nThree railways with different color train stops.\nFour trains listed in a train stop's GUI.\n1.1.0\n:\nTrain stop allows to set limit of incoming trains.\nFluids in train circuit logic treat summed < 1 fluid values as 1 instead of 0.\n0.17.0\n:\nTrain stop recipe now uses iron sticks.\n0.15.0\n:\nTrain station adds 2000 tiles penalty when path finding, so trains try to avoid stations not related to their path.\nTrain Stop can output the contents of the stopped train's cargo.\nTrain Stop can be disabled using the circuit network.\nWhen the active train stop is removed, trains will immediately leave the station if they're waiting at the station.\n0.13.0\n:\nNew graphics\nPlacement indicator\nIndicator of train position when stopped at station on hover.\n0.10.0\n:\nStation names can now be changed.\n0.7.0\n:\nShow the direction of incoming trains when being built.\nMultiple train stops for each train station.\n0.4.1\n:\nCannot be rotated after building.\n0.4.0\n:\nIntroduced\nLocomotive\nRailway\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Train_stop&oldid=207808\n\"",

With rail chain signals, it is possible to use multiple trains on a single track, or multiple rails that intertwine. Rail chain signals can be used to ensure that trains only enter a crossing if they can also leave it, which ensures that they do not block other traffic by waiting on the crossing. In addition to the explanation on this page, there is also the\nrail signal tutorial\n.\nContents\n1\nBasic\n2\nDefinition\n3\nAdvanced\n4\nUsage examples\n5\nHistory\n6\nSee also\nBasic\nThe best prerequisite to understand chain signals is to understand\nsignal blocks\n.\nRail chain signals are placed like regular signals at the right side of the railway track. If automated trains are required to drive in both directions on the same track segment, signals need to be added on both sides of the track, opposite each other.\nDefinition\nBoth normal signals and chain signals prevent a train from entering the next block if it is obstructed. However, a chain signal also looks ahead to the next signal, and turns red if the next signal is red. In effect, this prevents a train from entering a block if it won't be able to leave. When more than one exits exist, the one where the train is pathing to is considered.\nAdvanced\nIf the chain signal has only one exit, it doesn't allow the train to enter its block, if the train would have to stop in said block.\nSince trains react to chain signals based on their own path, chain signals before a crossing will not stop trains if the other track's exit is blocked.\nIf there are several chain signals before a regular one, a train waits before the first chain signal if the block after the regular signal is occupied.\nIf a chain signal switches to\ngreen\n, all exits are free.\nIf it switches to\nyellow\n, the block is reserved for a train and all other entrance signals of that block turn\nred\n.\nIf it switches to\nred\n, all exits are occupied.\nIf it switches to\nblue\n, some but not all exits are free. In this case trains may or may not stop, depending on their path.\nIf it is\nblinking\n, it is not on a rail, or unable to divide it into separate blocks.\nUsage examples\nRegular signal compared to a chain signal\nWith a regular signal, the block after it is empty, so the train can go there.\nChain signal with one exit doesn't allow the train to enter the block, since it can't leave immediately.\nSimple example with practical usage\nThe chain signal prevents the train from blocking the crossing route while waiting.\nDouble crossing\nDouble crossings are a common cause of train jams, as trains can stop in the middle of the crossing and block everything. It can even cause total deadlock, which require manual intervention to fix the problem. With chain signals, the rails that don't cross are still separated, but trains won't stop in the middle of the crossing.\nDeadlock prevention\nAnother common cause of blockages are bidirectional single track lines with occasional bypasses. Here a train can't enter the line because another train is in it, but that train in turn can't leave the line.\nWith chain signals, this problem can be totally avoided by preventing the train from going to the shared section unless it can exit it.\n0.16.0\n:\nRail chain signals can be read by the\ncircuit network\n.\n0.12.0\n:\nIntroduced\nRail signal\nRailway\nTutorial: Train signals\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Rail_chain_signal&oldid=185080\n\"",

Trains are useful for moving large amounts of items over large distances. With the\nSpace Age\nexpansion, locomotives can also utilize\nelevated rails\n, which are rails built off of a\nrail ramp\n, allowing trains to freely drive over obstacles on the ground.\nLocomotives are also good vehicles for the player to reach fixed destinations, as they are considerably faster than the\ncar\nor\ntank\n. Naturally, they do not have the same freedom of movement, as they are confined to the track. They can be set up to travel automatically between\ntrain stops\n, or be controlled manually, even if the\nplayer\nis in a\ncargo wagon\nattached to the train instead of the locomotive itself. Automatic trains can also use\nrail signals\nand\nrail chain signals\nto designate different or changing paths on a railway, as well as manage multiple trains on multiple or intertwining tracks.\nLocomotives are\nburner devices\nand require\nfuel\nto run; the more powerful the fuel used, the faster the locomotive's acceleration and top speed will be.\nSolid fuel\n,\nrocket fuel\nand\nnuclear fuel\nwill give +20%, +80% and +150% acceleration respectively, and provide +5%, +15% and +15% for top speed respectively. Multiple locomotives can be used on a single train to increase its speed. If a locomotive has no fuel, it can still be moved manually, albeit very slowly.\nWhile locomotives can be assembled by hand, the\nengine unit\nfor it requires\nautomated construction\nto build, so it cannot be built from raw materials by hand. The color of the locomotive can be customized.\nContents\n1\nConnecting/Disconnecting a locomotive\n2\nDefense\n3\nMaximum speed\n4\nFuel duration (in seconds)\n5\nDriving controls\n6\nAchievements\n7\nGallery\n8\nHistory\n9\nSee also\nConnecting/Disconnecting a locomotive\nLocomotive GUI\nTo connect locomotives, cargo wagons, or\nfluid wagons\nto each other, either place the cars next to each other on the track (there will be an outlined green connection), or connect an already existing disconnected car by driving the locomotive near the car and press\nG\nby default. To disconnect the last car in a train, press\nV\nby default.\nDefense\nLocomotives in transit can usually crash through everything in its way (including biters,\nother\nvehicles\n, and the player). However, if the locomotive is moving too slowly, or the target is too tough, it will stop the train instead. Once stopped, the train will continually do damage if trying to accelerate. If the locomotive hits an\nenemy\n, the enemies will fight back and try to destroy the train and the rails.\nConstruction robots\nare a good way to automatically repair damage at train stations.\nTrain killing three big biters.\nMaximum speed\nThe maximum speed that a locomotive can get to depends on the train that it is pulling. The speed of an accelerating, fully fueled, train is calculated every tick by the game with the following formula:\ntrain_speed = max(0, abs(train_speed) - train_friction_force ÷ train_weight)\ntrain_speed = train_speed + (10 × number_of_locomotives_in_moving_direction × fuel_acceleration_bonus ÷ train_weight)\ntrain_speed = train_speed × (1 - air_resistance_of_front_rolling_stock ÷ (train_weight ÷ 1000))\nwhere\ntrain_friction_force\nis the total friction of each wagon and locomotive (0.5 for any type of wagon including locomotives) and\ntrain_weight\nis the total weight of each wagon and locomotive (see their individual pages for the weight values). The friction and air resistance of wagons and locomotives can be found in their prototypes. The calculated\ntrain_speed\nis capped to\nmax_speed = 1.2 * fuel_top_speed_multiplier\n.\nFuel duration (in seconds)\n1 item of\nBurning time in seconds\n3.33\n6.67\n20\n166.67\n2016.67\nDriving controls\nThese are the default bindings, they can be changed in the Settings menu.\nCommand\nKeyboard and mouse\nController\nEnter/Exit\nENTER\nZR\n+\nX\nAccelerate\nW\nUse left joystick\nDecelerate/Reverse\nS\nUse left joystick\nPick which fork to take at junction (left, right)\nA\n,\nD\nUse left joystick\nConnect/Disconnect train\nG\n,\nV\nNot set\nWhen using a controller, such as on the\nNintendo Switch\n, the behaviour of the left joystick in vehicles can be switched between two modes:\nRelative vehicle driving mode (default): Moving the stick in a direction will make vehicles automatically turn and accelerate to that side of the screen.\nAbsolute vehicle driving mode: Moving the stick up/down will make vehicles accelerate/brake.

Up to 12 inserters per wagon are possible (from both sides).\nThe\ninserter item stack size\nis important to fill the wagon fast!\nIn manual-mode cargo wagons can only be filled or emptied when they are not moving. In automated-mode it is the same, but additionally they can only filled/empty, when stopped on a train-stop (not at a signal). A spot where inserters are positioned to transfer cargo for wagons is called a\ntrain station\n.\nWagons have a\nstack limitation\noption the same way chests do, which can be used to limit the number of transported items. Each stack in the cargo wagon can be filtered. This works in the same way as the filtering slots in other vehicles; the default key to define or remove the filter is the\nMiddle mouse button\n.\nPlayers\ncan enter a cargo wagon and control any connected locomotives.\nContents\n1\nProcessing of items before transport\n2\nUse as a big chest\n3\nHistory\n4\nSee also\nProcessing of items before transport\nA cargo wagon can be filled with 2000 items of ores (\ncopper\n,\niron\n, ...) or 4000 items of processed plates (\nCopper plates\n,\niron plates\n, ...). This can make preprocessing of ores into plates near the mines a useful strategy, because the transport of plates is more efficient.\nStack size is not the only factor to consider when comparing train transport of preprocessed items to raw items. Some raw items craft into a smaller amount of processed items. One example are iron plates, 5 iron plates can be crafted into 1 steel plate which means that when transported by train, the throughput increases by 5 times.\nUse as a big chest\nIt is possible to use the cargo wagon as a \"big chest\": Place rails, put an unmoving wagon on it and inserters around. The advantages of this construction are:\nCargo can be transferred with many more inserters than with a chest, bypassing the limitations of the\ninserter stack size bonus\n.\nItems are transported instantly over the length of the wagon. Correctly configured, this is faster than a transport belt.\nThe inventory slots can be filtered and the inventory size can be limited.\nDisadvantages include:\nIt cannot be connected to the\ncircuit network\n. Its contents can be read from a station if it is part of a train stopped at that station, but different wagons in the same train cannot be distinguished.\nIt cannot be accessed by\nlogistic robots\n.\nIt has a smaller capacity than a\nsteel chest\n(40 slots vs 48), which is not affected by\nquality\n.\n0.15.0\n:\nCargo wagons can have settings copied from any distance like Locomotives.\nTrain stop can output the contents of the stopped train's cargo to the\ncircuit network\n.\n0.14.0\n:\nAdded support for equipment grids in cargo wagons.\n0.13.0\n:\nNew cargo wagon graphics.\nIncreased inventory size of cargo wagon from 30 to 40 stacks.\n0.11.18\n:\nIncreased inventory size of cargo wagon from 20 to 30 stacks.\n0.10.1\n:\nIncreased inventory size of cargo wagon from 15 to 20 stacks.\n0.10.0\n:\nCargo wagon can have filters in the inventory.\n0.4.1\n:\nSmooth (precise) rolling stock placement.\nRotating while building affects the direction of the rolling stock.\nRolling stocks can be disconnected from both sides.\n0.4.0\n:\nIntroduced\nLocomotive\nFluid wagon\nRailway\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Cargo_wagon&oldid=206829\n\"",

Infinitely-stacking research upgrades are available for range and firing speed, but not damage.\nThe\nartillery turret\nis essentially the same weapon, but deployed as a static structure like\nother\nturrets\n.\nContents\n1\nMechanics\n2\nLimitations\n3\nTrain properties\n4\nLogistics\n5\nAchievements\n6\nTrivia\n7\nHistory\n8\nSee also\nMechanics\nArtillery wagons, like Artillery turrets, have a massive range, outranging non-Artillery fixed fortifications by a factor of 10 or more. In automatic mode, when the train is stopped, the artillery wagon will automatically scan for\nenemy structures\n(spawners and worms) and shoot at them. Automatic mode cannot target mobile units (biters and spitters); shells do, however, damage mobile units in the vicinity of impact normally.\nIn manual mode, an\nArtillery targeting remote\nis used to point-and-click anywhere in the world, map, or zoomed-in map; each click corresponds to one shell delivered to that location, so long as any working artillery turrets and / or wagons are in range. Targeting remotes show the number of fire-ready (loaded and, for wagons, stationary) artillery pieces in range of cursor position when held. Manual fire can be ordered on unexplored areas; shells will explore all chunks they travel across (but no surrounding chunks).\nRange in automatic mode is 224 tiles (7 chunks); in manual mode, 560 tiles (17.5 chunks). Infinite\nresearch\nis available to increase range, at +30% of base range per level, applied to both automatic and manual range.\nLimitations\nAside from the considerable expense of research and assembly for both wagons and shells, there are certain considerations that make these wagons unwise as a full replacement for traditional base defenses, despite their phenomenal range and the advantage of mobility.\nArtillery shelling will antagonize enemy mobile units in the vicinity of the impact into rushing the wagon's location at time of firing, regardless of their normal \"aggro radius\". Artillery wagons are relatively slow-firing, although infinite\nresearch\nis available to improve firing speed, at +100% per level, affecting both wagons and stationary turrets and applying to both automatic and manual mode. They also cannot target mobile units in automatic mode. Importantly, artillery has a\nminimum\nrange as well, which is 32 tiles.\nTogether, these limitations mean that an artillery wagon needs to be defended, or else moved around rapidly, in the latter case decreasing its value as base defense. For defense, any conventional approach such as walls, gun, laser, and / or flamethrower turrets, or the personal intervention of the player will do. However, players should keep in mind that extensive shelling of large biter-infested areas will produce massive attack waves centered on the position of the artillery piece at time of firing, and should plan close-range defenses accordingly.\nLogistic considerations are also important, as artillery shells have a stack size of 1, meaning any-size container can only hold a modest supply and an inserter will only ever move a single shell at a time. Players may wish to consider assembling near artillery wagon stops if practical. The wagon itself can hold a supply of 100 shells (while artillery turrets only hold 15), providing a portable magazine of some size that can be towed around with the weapon without external storage.\nTrain properties\nThe artillery wagon can fire while stopped at a train stop, but\nnot\nwhen stopped at a red signal or when moving. A train in automatic mode that is \"No-Path\"ing will not fire. When a train with an artillery wagon is stopped at a train stop, aiming and shooting counts as activity for the purposes of \"X seconds of inactivity\" departure conditions in the train's schedule. This includes the time that the wagon spends scanning the area around it to find enemies, which is done at 1 chunk per tick. Only when it has scanned all chunks and did not find an enemy it will count as inactive.\nWhen part of a manual-mode (player-driven) train, artillery wagons will fire whenever the train is stopped, regardless of where it was stopped.\nArtillery wagons weigh as much as 4\nregular wagons\n(or 2\nlocomotives\n) for the purposes of train acceleration calculations. Fortunately,\nnuclear fuel\nprovides a massive 250% boost to acceleration (compared to 180% for rocket fuel, the next best type), making it an attractive fuel for artillery trains.\nLogistics\nIn addition to firing them, artillery wagons can be used to transport shells from place to place. Inserters will both load and unload artillery wagons in the same manner as they would any other wagon, with the obvious difference that artillery wagons can only take artillery shells as cargo. However, each artillery wagon can hold 100 shells, while a regular cargo wagon only holds 40.\nThus, artillery wagons are the most space-efficient method of transporting artillery shells by rail. They are not, however, the most mass-efficient one, as an artillery wagon weighs 4 times as much as a regular wagon, but holds only 2.5 times as many shells. Thus, if train length is not a concern but acceleration and / or fuel efficiency is, regular wagons are superior for transporting shells.\nAchievements\nArt of siege\nDestroy an enemy structure using\nartillery\n.\nKeeping your hands clean\nDestroy your first enemy structure using\nartillery\n.\nTrivia\nLarge rail-transported cannon\nwere built in the late 19th and early 20th century, up until and including World War II. The larger models were heavy and very slow firing and took many hours to set up, but had a greater range and power per shot than any other weapon in existence at the time (considerably greater than battleship-size naval guns, for example). The advent of rocketry, as well as large bomber planes capable of deploying multi-ton bombs, eventually made these guns obsolete.\nPerhaps the best-known example is the\nSchwerer Gustav\n(Heavy Gustav), the largest gun ever fired.\n2.0.7\n:\nTrains with artillery wagons now need to wait for all cannons to be in fully their parked position before departing. When driving manually, keep holding accelerate to command the artillery to stop firing and assume their parked position.\nDoubled the damage of Artillery\n0.16.0\n:\nIntroduced\nFriday Facts #220 - The best Friday Facts ever\nArtillery turret\nArtillery shell\nArtillery targeting remote\nLocomotive\nRailway\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Artillery_wagon&oldid=213891\n\"",

Although it requires fuel, driving a car is much faster than running, letting the player scout out areas or outmaneuver\nenemies\n. Cars have a vehicle machine gun that has a 50% higher rate of fire and can fire two tiles farther than the\nsubmachine gun\n, 80 slots of storage and 450 health, allowing the player to use hit-and-run tactics against small groups of enemies.\nCars can collide with objects. Both the car and the object collided with may take damage. The damage is dependent on the speed of the car and the health of the target; small biters and trees can be safely rammed but colliding with big biters can easily destroy the vehicle and its contents. If the car is destroyed, its inventory is destroyed with it, though the player gets ejected and not killed.\nIn multiplayer, it is possible for a player to enter a car alongside another player. The passenger can take control of the weapons of the car using a switch in the GUI of the car, but cannot steer the car. Cars will take on the color of the player who drove it last.\nCars are moved by\ntransport belts\nand\ninserters\ncan interact with them. Because of that, cars may be used as large chests or as another mean of transportation besides belts,\ntrains\nand\nrobots\n.\nControls\nMain article:\nControls\nAccelerating opposite of the velocity of the car will cause it to brake.

It is a mid-game vehicle with three weapons; an integrated\nsubmachine gun\n, a short range\nflamethrower\nand a powerful cannon that uses\ncannon shells\n. It, along with the\ncar\nand\nspidertron\n, are the three non-rail vehicles in Factorio. In\nmultiplayer\n, it is possible for a\nplayer\nto enter a tank alongside another player. The passenger can take control of the weapons of the tank using a switch in the GUI of the tank, but cannot steer the tank.\nSince\nengine units\ncan only be built in\nassembling machines\n, tanks (like cars) cannot be built from scratch by hand from their raw materials. If the tank is destroyed, its inventory is destroyed with it, though the player gets ejected and not killed. Tanks will change color based on the color of the player who drove it last.\nTanks can be driven remotely. Coupled with the tank's equipment grid, the player can remotely manipulate distant outposts without being there as well as to remotely expand the base by attacking enemy\nnests\n. However, unlike the spidertron, the tank lacks any map-revealing capabilities, and so is effectively confined to areas where the player has sufficient\nradar\ncoverage. The tank and its weapons continue to operate normally if driven outside of visual range, but if the player \"exits\" the vehicle while in the fog of war then the tank will be stranded until visual contact can be re-established.\nContents\n1\nAchievements\n2\nCombat\n3\nMovement\n4\nSpeeds\n4.1\nTank top speed (km/h)\n4.2\nSpeed in reverse\n5\nCapsules and Bots integration\n6\nExclusive Weapons\n6.1\nFlamethrower\n6.2\nCannon\n7\nHistory\n8\nDevelopment data\n9\nSee also\nAchievements\nSteamrolled\nDestroy 10\nspawners\nby impact.\nRun Forrest, run\nDestroy 100\ntrees\nby impact.\nCombat\nThe tank is a strong fighting vehicle due to its large health pool and the very high damage of its main weapon, the cannon.\nConstruction robots\ncan also repair the tank with\nrepair packs\n, and the tank can even bring its own robots to do so using the\npersonal roboport\nequipment.\nThe tank's weaponry can be augmented by equipment modules like the\npersonal laser defense\n. If the player is inside of the tank, the player can deploy thrown items such as\ngrenades\n,\npoison capsules\n, and\nfollower robots\nfrom within the tank. The tank particularly shines in battle against\nworms\n, as their high damage projectiles are much less of a problem for an entity with a high health pool. Defensive equipment or capsules/drones can be used to deal with mobile enemies.\nThe tank has a lower base speed than the car and is less maneuverable than a player outside of a vehicle. As a result, it may not perform as well in combat against melee enemies or enemies with shorter range than the player, as it has more difficulty dodging enemies and avoiding\ncliffs\n. This may result in the tank being destroyed quickly, leaving the player in a tight spot.\nMovement\nThe tank is very robust, and unlike the car can move through and destroy\ntrees\nwithout taking damage. Even when not moving, simply driving into an entity is enough to damage it. This can also be employed as a weapon against\nenemies\n, although certain enemies and structures (nests in particular) will deal high damage to the tank in the process, requiring repair after skirmishes.\nThe tank's default speed is slower than the car, and movement speed bonuses from terrain (e.g.\nconcrete\n) are substantially reduced. Unlike the car, the tank can be rotated in place without moving forwards or backwards.\nThe speed and, in particular, responsiveness of the tank can be improved somewhat by burning better\nfuel\n. The tank, like all other vehicles, gains top speed and acceleration bonuses when running on solid fuel, rocket fuel and nuclear fuel, as opposed to wood or coal. The bonuses are +5% / +15% / +15% top speed and +20% / +80% / +150% acceleration for solid fuel, rocket fuel and nuclear fuel, respectively; wood and coal both yield the base level of top speed and acceleration.\nExoskeletons\ncan also be installed into the tank's equipment grid to increase its top speed as though the tank was the player. Equipping 3 exoskeletons allows the tank to outrun a car on any natural terrain, and with 5 exoskeletons the tank surpasses the car's maximum possible speed. Increasing the tank's speed with exoskeletons does not affect the tank's acceleration or deceleration, so it will take some time for the tank to accelerate to its top speed, as well as to stop from that speed. Given how destructive the tank can be to buildings, using many exoskeletons in a tank can make it dangerous to one's own base.\nSpeeds\nTank top speed (km/h)\nTop speed with various fuels on different tiles\nWood\nCoal\nSolid fuel\nRocket fuel\nNuclear fuel\nSand\n50.1\n50.1\n54.8\n67.1\n79.1\nGrass\n50.9\n50.9\n55.8\n68.3\n80.5\nRed desert\n50.9\n50.9\n55.8\n68.3\n80.5\nDirt\n51.4\n51.4\n56.8\n69.6\n82.0\nStone path\n53.4\n53.4\n58.5\n71.6\n84.4\nShallow water\n53.9\n53.9\n59.1\n72.3\n85.3\nConcrete\n*\n55.0\n55.0\n60.3\n73.8\n87.0\nRefined concrete\n*\n55.0\n55.0\n60.3\n73.8\n87.0\n* The same stats apply to the\nhazard\nversion\nof these surfaces.\nSpeed in reverse\nThe top speed of the tank in reverse is ~70.6% of the forward top speed.\nCapsules and Bots integration\nThe player directly driving the tank cannot fire any weapons equipped on the player. However, the player still has access to their inventory. The player can use inventory items, such as\ncapsules\nand\ncombat robots\n. The player's\nequipment modules\nare also available, so the player's\nconstruction robots\nrun by a\npersonal roboport\ncan still be deployed from within the tank, which will use\nrepair packs\nfrom the player to repair the tank. If the tank and the player both have\npersonal laser defenses\n, both can be active at the same time.\nUpon researching\nlogistic system\n, the tank can utilize the\nlogistic network\nto make requests like a player.\nExclusive Weapons\nFlamethrower\nA powerful short-ranged weapon that consumes\nflamethrower ammo\n. Unlike the hand-held\nflamethrower\nor the\nflamethrower turret\n, the tank version does not set entities on fire.\nCannon\nThe tank's cannon is one of the few weapons that damages anything in a line between the tank and the target. All cannon shells have the ability to pierce targets, which means that if the shell deals enough damage to kill what it hits, the shell can continue onward and deal damage to another target.\nStandard\ncannon shells\ndeal significant damage to a single target and have large piercing potential, while\nexplosive cannon shells\ndamage all targets in an area which makes them useful for dealing with large enemy groups.

It, along with the\ncar\nand\ntank\n, is one of three non-rail vehicles in Factorio. It's equipped with four fast-firing rocket launchers capable of manual or automatic targeting. It can be driven manually or remotely controlled using the\nspidertron remote\n. Furthermore, it has an equipment grid which accepts all\nequipment modules\n. Spidertron's legs can be moved by belts which can be prevented by inserting\nbelt immunity equipment\ninto its equipment grid.\nThe vehicle can be renamed, and its color can be changed independently of the color of the player that is riding inside it. This color and name are shown in the tooltip of all connected\nspidertron remotes\n. Additionally, the spidertron's inventory can have logistics requests and auto-trash filters set up, similar to the\nplayer\ninventory, so the vehicle is automatically supplied by\nlogistic robots\n.\nPicking up the vehicle keeps the modules inside its equipment grid, its name, its color and the logistics requests saved in the item, however any content from the spidertron's inventory is placed into the player's inventory and not saved in the item.\nContents\n1\nCombat\n2\nSpeed\n3\nTrivia\n4\nGallery\n5\nAchievements\n6\nHistory\n7\nSee also\nCombat\nThe four spidertron rocket launchers operate in \"chain mode\" which allows rapid firing of rockets at enemies. The spidertron can be set to automatically target enemies, both with or without any passengers inside the spidertron. The spidertron's combat capabilities are enhanced by its equipment grid, e.g.\nenergy shields\ncan be equipped to increase its protection or\npersonal laser defenses\ncan be used for higher killing power. The spidertron's equipment modules are used additionally to any modules that the riding player may have equipped in their own\npower armor\n.\nSpeed\nUnlike the car and tank, which are affected by the surfaces they travel on, the spidertron's speed does not change on different surfaces. Due to the way the spidertron travels, its speed slightly fluctuates and does not consistently stay at its top speed. The spidertron does not take any\nfuel\n, therefore its speed can be only increased by equipping\nexoskeletons\ninto its grid. Up to 5 exoskeletons can fit in the vehicle's grid. The top speeds (in km/h) are as follows:\nEquipment\nTop speed\nDefault\n~46\n1 exoskeleton\n~57\n2 exoskeletons\n~68\n3 exoskeletons\n~85\n4 exoskeletons\n~90\n5 exoskeletons\n~102\nTrivia\nThe spidertron was first mentioned in the\nFriday Facts #120\n, however it was not introduced into the game and did not appear on the roadmap. After FFF #120 the spidertron was sometimes hidden in other Friday Facts such as\nFFF #200\n,\nFFF #315\nand\nFFF #330\n. However, the spidertron was not developed further after its first mention: \"Than maybe he felt FFF was too short that week, so he made the gif, and it was not touched ever since\".\nIt was then introduced in version 1.0.0 as a surprise feature, more than 4 years after it was first teased.\nThe spidertron is the only item in the game to require\nraw fish\nas a crafting ingredient. It is not known for certain why this is the case, although it could be to limit the automatability of spidertron production (since raw fish production is challenging to automate).\nIn\nSpace Age\n, the ingredients for a spidertron are shared between\nNauvis\nand\nGleba\n. Both raw fish and the\nuranium-235\nneeded for the\nportable fission reactor\ncan only be obtained on Nauvis, while the\ncarbon fiber\nneeded for\nrocket turrets\ncan only be acquired on\nGleba\n. As such, automating spidertron production requires regular transport between the two planets.\nA legendary spidertron with its equipment grid filled with 55 legendary\ntoolbelt equipment\nmodules has a total inventory size of 1575 slots.\nThe spidertron's GUI with a partially filled equipment grid and multiple equipped rockets.\nThe spidertron's corpse.\nSpidertron effortlessly walking through trees.\nControlling spidertron's movement via minimap.\n(Click to see .GIF animation.)\nAchievements\nArachnophilia\nBuild a\nspidertron\n.\n2.0.7\n:\nVehicles no longer have input delay due to server latency.\n1.1.0\n:\nAdded logistic requests to spidertron.\nAdded ability to queue up multiple waypoints for a single Spidertron.\nAdded option to follow another entity.\n1.0.0\n:\nIntroduced.\nVehicle\nTank\nEquipment modules\nResistances\nEnemies\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Spidertron&oldid=214085\n\"",

It can be created with\nALT\n+\nA\nor by pressing the respective button on the\nshortcut bar\nafter unlocking the spidertron\nresearch\n.\nFirst, the remote needs to be connected to spidertrons. This is done by, when holding a remote, holding\nLeft mouse button\nand dragging over one or more spidertrons.\nOnce a group of spidertrons is selected with a remote, clicking\nRight mouse button\nwith the remote in the world or map view will prompt the connected spidertron(s) to move to the selected location. They will move to that location in a straight line from their current position, not attempting to pathfind around obstacles.\nA sequence of move commands can be queued by using\nSHIFT\n+\nRight mouse button\nwith the remote in the world or map view. Queuing move commands allows creating complex paths for the spidertron. The queued goal positions and their connections are drawn in the spidertron's color both in the map view and in the world. Alternatively,\nSHIFT\n+\nRight mouse button\nwith the remote can be used to command the spidertron(s) to follow a specific entity, such as a\nplayer\nor another\nvehicle\n.\nOnce connected to spidertrons, the remote can be placed in the\nquickbar\nfor easy access. Remotes placed here will remember its connected spidertron(s) and will remain in the quickbar even if the player dies.\nIf playing in\nSpace Age\n, a remote placed in the quickbar will remember its connected spidertron(s) even if the player is on another planet. It will also remember which planet those spidertrons are on. The remote's icon in the quickbar will gain a small overlay showing which planet the spidertron(s) are on, if that is not the same planet the player is currently viewing.

When they run out of power, they have to recharge at a\nroboport\n, or a\npersonal roboport\n, depending on where the robots were originally placed.

It emits an area of 50×50 tiles, in which logistic robots can interact with logistic network entities, such as\nstorage chests\n, or\nrequester chests\n. Additionally, a 110×110 tile area is created for construction robots to repair, construct or remove structures. This can be seen by hovering the mouse on a roboport, or logistics chest which is inside the logistic zone.\nThe smaller\norange\nsquare represents the reach of the logistics network where both logistics and construction robots can move.\nThe larger\ngreen\nsquare represents the extent of the construction network where only construction robots can move.\nRobots placed into the air from the\nplayer's\ninventory inside of a roboport's coverage will seek out the nearest roboport to charge and rest.\nTwo or more roboports can connect to form a\nlogistic network\n, if the borders of the orange logistic areas touch. This is shown by a dotted line running between the two ports. An example of this can be seen on the bottom-right. Non-connected roboports will not share robots.\nSimilar to the stationary\nradar\n's nearby scanning, a roboport constantly reveals an area of 5×5 chunks, centered on the chunk the roboport occupies.\nTwo roboports connecting to form a logistic network. Notice the yellow dotted line indicating a successful bond.\nContents\n1\nStorage\n2\nPower usage\n3\nInteraction with personal roboports\n4\nHistory\n5\nSee also\nStorage\nA roboport contains 7\nslots\n, each reserved for 50\nrobots\nof the same type, and another 7 for\nrepair packs\n. Robots and repair packs can be inserted into the roboport with an\ninserter\n. Furthermore, robots (but not repair packs) can be removed from the roboport with an inserter. Repair packs inside a roboport are available for all robots and requester chests inside the logistic zone of that roboport. Construction bots, when provided with repair packs, will automatically repair all damaged structures inside of a roboport's coverage area.\nIf a roboport is full of robots, robots attempting to rest will find a different roboport, if one is available.\nIt's possible to request idle robots from other roboports by configuring corresponding requests in the roboport GUI. This way it's possible to request one type or\nquality\nof robot, then remove them from the roboport with a filtered inserter, to gradually clean a logistics network from this type of robot.\nRoboport GUI\nPower usage\nRoboports have 4 chargers, which are used to recharge the flying bots. More roboports in a small area will allow for greater charging throughput, if a lot of robots need charging. Robots waiting to be charged will float in place near the roboport and wait their turn.\nRobots will not enter a roboport to rest unless they have full charge. Robots with low/no charge can still fly, but will move extremely slowly.\nInteraction with personal roboports\nAn entity with an equipment grid (usually a\ncharacter\nwearing armor that grants one, but also a\ntank\nor\nspidertron\n) equipped with a\npersonal roboport\nor\npersonal roboport MK2\ncan act as a mobile roboport. This mobile roboport uses the associated entity's own inventory rather than the local logistic network for robot, item and repair pack storage.

It can be used to increase visibility in a factory, so\nnightvision\nis not needed. Lamps can be toggled to always be on, regardless of time of day.\nContents\n1\nColor\n2\nTrivia\n3\nHistory\n4\nSee also\nColor\nLamp colors can be changed by customizing the color with RGB values. This can also be done by sending a color signal to the lamp. When the condition inside the lamp passes, instead of lighting up white, it will use that color. This can be used to create colored displays, or indicate status. If more than one color signal is received, precedence is given to them in the order below (i.e. if red and green are received, the lamp will light red). As of now, attempting to use grey or black signals will just dim the lamp's light range, making those signal colors somewhat useless.\nWhen attached to a circuit, and the \"Use colors\" option is selected, the lamp can be configured to use color mapping, which controls the lamp's output based on color signals passed to it, or color components can be used, which are specified by red, blue and green signals separately. A packed RGB value can also be used, which uses an eight digit hex color for the color. The lamp can appear as black when the color components option is used while being turned off.\nTrivia\nCircuit-controlled lamps have a significantly reduced light range.\n0.17.0\n:\nBalancing: Lamp recipe iron sticks ingredient changed to copper cables.\n0.13.16\n:\nChanged default value of \"lights render resolution\" graphics option to 0.25.

The input wires connect to the nubs on the left side of the sprite in the sidebar, while the outputs connect to the right side.\nContents\n1\nFunction\n2\nNotes on operations\n3\nHistory\n4\nSee also\nFunction\nThe operands can be any single signal or a constant value. Up to one of the operands can be the\neach\nvirtual signal\n. For each signal operand, the input wires can be selected. If both wires are selected, the inputs are summed.\nIf neither operand is the\neach\nsignal, the output must be a single signal. The operation is performed on the values of the chosen left and right signals, and the result is sent to the output on the specified signal.\nIf one operand is the\neach\nsignal, then the output can be a single signal or the\neach\nsignal. If the output is the\neach\nsignal, then the operation is performed individually on the value of each input signal along with the value of the other operand, and each result is sent to the output on the same signal. If the output is a single signal, the operation is done on each of the input signals, the individual results are all added together, and that result is sent to the output on the specified signal.\nNotes on operations\nWhen using\ndivision\n, the result is truncated:\n21 / 10 = 2\n19 / 10 = 1\n−21 / 10 = −2\n−19 / 10 = −1\n21 / −10 = −2\n19 / −10 = −1\n−21 / −10 = 2\n−19 / −10 = 1\nModulo\n, indicated using % as it is in most programming languages, is the remainder after division. For example, 13 % 3 is 1 (13 = 4 * 3 + 1). This can, for example, be combined with truncated division as described above to separate out individual digits of a number for use in building visual indicators:\n(24321 / 10000) % 10 = 2\n(24321 / 1000) % 10 = 4\n(24321 / 100) % 10 = 3\n(24321 / 10) % 10 = 2\n(24321 / 1) % 10 = 1\nNegating the left operand of a modulo negates the result, while negating the right operand does nothing:\n13 % 3 = 1\n13 % −3 = 1\n−13 % 3 = −1\n−13 % −3 = −1\nBit shift right\nand\nBit shift left\ndeal with numbers in the\nbinary\nrepresentation. The 0's and 1's that make up a number are shifted in the specified direction which can result in a completely different number, due to the change in the binary value. The shift performed is called arithmetic shift, because it preserves the sign bit on bit shift right.\nIf shifting left, a 0 is inserted into the least significant bit (LSB), and the bit in the most significant bit (MSB) is lost.\nIf shifting right and the number is positive (MSB=0), a 0 is inserted into the MSB and the bit in the LSB is lost.\nIf shifting right and the number is negative (MSB=1), a 1 is inserted into the MSB to keep the sign and the bit in the LSB is lost.\nExample of a 'bit shift left'.\nExample of a 'bit shift right (positive number)'.\nExample of a 'bit shift right (negative number)'.\n2.0.7\n:\nReceived a UI overhaul.\nNow displays input signals when configuring combinators.\nSignals used by combinators can now be filtered between red, green, or both.\n0.15.0\n:\nAdded Modulo, Power, Left Bit Shift, Right Bit Shift, Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR and Bitwise XOR to the Arithmetic Combinator.\n0.13.0\n:\nConnected wires are highlighted when hovering over a combinator connected to the\ncircuit network\n.\nCombinators show input and output in alt mode.\nMore virtual signals for combinators.\nNew combinator graphics.\n0.12.5\n:\nCombinators now emit light.\n0.12.2\n:\nCombinators no longer turn off when no wires are connected.\n0.12.0\n:\nIntroduced\nCircuit network\nCombinators\nDecider combinator\nConstant combinator\nSelector combinator\nCombinator tutorial\nCircuit network cookbook\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Arithmetic_combinator&oldid=214173\n\"",

Generally whenever the conditions are satisfied the outputs are activated.\nA condition consists of a \"first\" input signal, a comparison (>, <, =, >=, <=, !=), and a \"second\" input signal or constant. Additionally, for each input signal the input wires to read the signal from can be specified.

The valid bounds is 0 through 1 less the total quantity of input signals.\nIf a single input signal is provided, it is\nalways\npassed through even if the index is out of bounds.\nCount inputs\nThe combinator will count and output the number of unique inputs on the selected signal.\nThe value of the input signals is not considered.\nRandom input\nThe combinator will pass through a random input signal every certain number of\ngame ticks\n.\nBy default, the combinator will update this every 1 tick, or 60 times per second.\nIf there is only one input signal, it will be output after this threshold is met. If the input is removed before that happens, nothing will be output.\nStack size\nThe combinator will output the stack sizes of the input items.\nThe combinator will not output any fluid or\nvirtual signals\n.\nThe value of the input items is not considered.\nRocket capacity\nThe combinator will output the rocket capacity of the input signals.\nThe combinator will not output any fluids, virtual signals, or items too heavy for a rocket (the\natomic bomb\nand\nrocket silo\n.)\nThe value of the input items is not considered.\nQuality filter\nThe combinator will pass through any input signals that meet a conditional against a certain\nquality\ngrade.\nThe combinator can compare an input's quality that is greater than, less than, equal to, greater or equal to, less or equal to, or not equal to, any one quality grade.\nIf comparing against\nany\nquality grade, the only valid comparison is\nequal to\n.\nQuality transfer\nThe combinator will take the selected\ntarget signal\nfrom its inputs and output it with a particular quality grade.\nIf\ndirect selection\nis selected, the combinator will attach the specified quality grade to the target signal, but only if that target signal is among the inputs.\nIf\nselect from input\nis selected, the combinator will search for the selected item within its inputs and apply the quality of selected input to the target signal, but only if both the selected input and the target signal are among the inputs.\n2.0.7\n:\nIntroduced\nCircuit network\nCombinators\nDecider combinator\nArithmetic combinator\nConstant combinator\nCombinator tutorial\nCircuit network cookbook\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Selector_combinator&oldid=214175\n\"",

It can be connected to the circuit network to produce an alert when a signal drops below a certain value, for example.\nGUI and configuration\nIt can be toggled whether the sound plays globally so that it can be heard anywhere on the map, or locally so it will only be audible in the immediate vicinity of the speaker. As a courtesy, only enable global play on multiplayer when it is important that all players be notified. Only 50 sounds can be heard at once due to a game limitation.\nThe volume of the programmable speaker can be controlled in the GUI. This determines the audio volume, and the carry distance if global playback is unticked. The range at full volume appears to be 64 tiles.\nAs well as playing a sound, it can also be set to send a GUI text alert so the player can see what has caused the alarm. Both text and an icon can be specified, as seen in the check mark image above. In order to show an\nalert\nin players' GUIs, \"Show alert\" must be ticked. Additional options will be shown that allow the player to select an icon and text for the alert.\nThe \"Allow polyphony\" check-box determines whether more than one sound may be played at once. Essentially, when hooking up a constant signal to a programmable speaker, with polyphony enabled, sounds will repeat extremely rapidly. (10 per second or so) Without polyphony, this is limited to about 1 per half second. Disabling polyphony is useful to avoid alerts being spammed and causing hearing damage. However, if producing music, polyphony may be needed.\nThe \"Circuit value is pitch\" check-box allows dynamically changing the pitch of the sound created by changing the circuit value. This is useful for music production. If the player simply wants a sound to be created whenever the conditional is met, they should disable this check-box.\n2.0.7\n:\nStack size reduced from 50 to 10.\n0.17.66\n:\nProgrammable Speaker sounds now change volume accordingly as player moves.\n0.15.0\n:\nIntroduced\nCircuit network\nLogistics\nStorage\nWooden chest\nIron chest\nSteel chest\nStorage tank\nBelt transport system\nTransport belt\nFast transport belt\nExpress transport belt\nTurbo transport belt\n(\n)\nUnderground belt\nFast underground belt\nExpress underground belt\nTurbo underground belt\n(\n)\nSplitter\nFast splitter\nExpress splitter\nTurbo splitter\n(\n)\nInserters\nBurner inserter\nInserter\nLong-handed inserter\nFast inserter\nBulk inserter\nStack inserter\n(\n)\nElectric system\n&\nFluid system\nSmall electric pole\nMedium electric pole\nBig electric pole\nSubstation\nPipe\nPipe to ground\nPump\nRailway\nRail\nRail ramp\n(\n)\nRail support\n(\n)\nTrain stop\nRail signal\nRail chain signal\nLocomotive\nCargo wagon\nFluid wagon\nArtillery wagon\nTransport\nCar\nTank\nSpidertron\nSpidertron remote\nLogistic network\nLogistic robot\nConstruction robot\nActive provider chest\nPassive provider chest\nStorage chest\nBuffer chest\nRequester chest\nRoboport\nCircuit network\nLamp\nRed wire\nGreen wire\nArithmetic combinator\nDecider combinator\nSelector combinator\nConstant combinator\nPower switch\nProgrammable speaker\nDisplay panel\nTerrain\nStone brick\nConcrete\nHazard concrete\nRefined concrete\nRefined hazard concrete\nLandfill\nArtificial yumako soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth yumako soil\n(\n)\nArtificial jellynut soil\n(\n)\nOvergrowth jellynut soil\n(\n)\nIce platform\n(\n)\nFoundation\n(\n)\nCliff explosives\nNavigation\nProduction\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Programmable_speaker&oldid=202030\n\"",

If connected to the\ncircuit network\n, the display panel can be set up to showcase different icons and messages depending on what conditional signals are being passed to it.\nIf a description is included in a display panel, hovering the mouse over it will display all lines of text. There is an option that allows for the first line of a description to always be displayed above the entity even when not selected. If this option is unselected, no text will appear above the entity unless the player hovers their mouse over it. There is a second option that allows the chosen icon and first line of a description to be shown on the minimap and remote view.\nIt is worth noting that, unlike\nlamps\nor\nspeakers\n, display panels do not use any power, and do not require electric network coverage at all.\nCircuit network functionality\nBesides being able to show static icons and text, display panels can be connected to the circuit network. This allows the player to specify a list of simple conditions and display settings. Conditions are evaluated in order, from top to bottom, showing the icon and text of the first one that matches. If none match, the display turns off.\nConditions and display settings also offer\nlogic signals\nas an option.

Blueprints are used to 'copy & paste' parts of a factory. Built areas can be selected for inclusion in a blueprint. When a blueprint is placed, a\nghost\nof the layout appears on the ground. This can be used as a guide for manually placing factory pieces, or, more commonly, handed over to\nconstruction robots\nfor automated completion.\nBlueprints can be stored in a\nblueprint book\nor\nblueprint library\nto prevent them occupying inventory space or for organization or sharing purposes.\nContents\n1\nAchievements\n2\nUsage\n2.1\nCreate a blueprint\n2.2\nBlueprint icon setup\n2.3\nPlacing the blueprint\n2.4\nViewing and clearing a blueprint\n2.5\nParameterisation\n3\nImporting/Exporting blueprints\n4\nAdditional information\n5\nTrivia\n6\nHistory\n7\nSee also\nAchievements\nAutomated construction\nConstruct 100 machines using\nrobots\n.\nYou are doing it right\nConstruct more machines using\nrobots\nthan manually.\nUsage\nBlank blueprints can be crafted by clicking the (\n) button in the\nshortcut bar\n. The blank blueprint can now be used to 'copy' a set of buildings. For example, copying this small gun turret defense setup:\nCreate a blueprint\nTo create a blueprint select the blueprint item out of the toolbar or the inventory.\nWith the blueprint icon shown next to the mouse cursor, click and hold the left mouse button and drag a box as large as needed (which can be cancelled by pressing\nQ\n).\nAll player-placed entities which will be included in the blueprint will be highlighted with a green square.\nOnce everything you intend to 'copy' is inside the drag box, release the mouse button and the 'Blueprint icon setup' menu will open.\nBlueprint icon setup\nOn the top left of the \"Setup new blueprint\" menu there are four icon slots. These are displayed on the blueprint's icon and can be used to quickly identify a blueprint. When creating a new blueprint, the game automatically selects some of the icons representing the entities in the blueprint.\nThese default icons can be changed by simply clicking on the icons to choose the desired ones.\nOn the left the 'Total' number of components included in the blueprint is shown.\nThe purple \"Parameterise\" button in the top right is used to configure the settings of any buildings or\ncircuit network\nentity within the blueprint. More on this feature below.\nThe green \"Create blueprint\" button creates the blueprint. Additionally, blueprint creation can be cancelled by clicking the X in the top right corner. Canceling the blueprint does not consume the blueprint item. The created blueprint will replace the empty blueprint in the player's cursor.\nPlacing the blueprint\nTo use/place the created blueprint select it from the tool belt or inventory. The process of placing a blueprint is very similar to that of using\ncopy and paste\nfunctionality.\nWhen you select a blueprint, the whole building setup of the blueprint will be shown at your mouse cursor. In this case the Blueprint was renamed to \"Example blueprint\".\nThe blueprint can be rotated using the\nR\nkey.\nH\nwill flip it horizontally;\nV\nwill flip it vertically. Note that blueprints which contain\nrail signals\n,\nchain signals\n, or\ntrain stops\ncannot be flipped, only rotated.\nPlacing a blueprint creates\nghost\nentities. If these are within the green (or orange) 110×110 tiles area of a\nroboport\n, or within range of a\npersonal roboport\ninstalled in\nmodular armor\nor\nspidertron\n, construction robots may be able to build them using available materials.\nHolding\nShift\nwill activate \"Force Building\" mode. This will mark all trees and rocks underneath the blueprint for deconstruction, as well as place ghosts for\nlandfill\nif building over water. If playing in\nSpace Age\n, it will instead place\nice platform\nor\nfoundation\n, depending on what is appropriate for the current planet.\nHolding\nControl\n+\nShift\nwill activate \"Super Force Building\" mode. This acts the same as force building, but will also mark\nall\nother buildings for deconstruction. If building over\ntransport belts\n, the game will attempt to place ghosts for\nunderground belts\nof the same tier, if possible.\nAfter the blueprint gets placed somewhere, the buildings are placed as ghost buildings.\nConstruction robots\nwill now start to pick up the needed items from the construction network/the player inventory (if using a personal roboport) and place them at the ghost buildings.\nThe required items need to be in the network in an\nactive provider chest\n, a\npassive provider chest\n, a\nbuffer chest\nor a\nstorage chest\n.\nBlueprints can be placed from map view as long as the area has been explored.\nViewing and clearing a blueprint\nRight clicking on a blueprint allows you to view, edit and clear it.\nBy clearing it, it will become blank so it can be set again.\nParameterisation\nNearly everything in the game that can be configured can also be parameterised within a blueprint. Settings which would have had to be changed manually one at a time can be set automatically with a single selection during blueprint construction. This allows for more generic blueprints which can be specifically configured for a particular need.\nSome settings which can be parameterised include, but are not limited to:\nRecipes in buildings\nOutput control signals for the\ncircuit network\nIcons, their values, and constants within\ncombinators\nand their descriptions\nRich text\ntags within the names of\ntrain stops\n, among other buildings\nThe following example will demonstrate parameterisation with a constant combinator:\nIn the above image, we have an\niron plate\nsignal with a value of 5, a\ncopper plate\nsignal with a value of 10, and a virtual signal \"A\" with a value of 1. By clicking the purple parameterisation button in the top right of the blueprint setup screen, we get the parameterisation GUI:\nThere is a separate parameter for each unique signal and their values. Hovering the mouse over each value will tell you the origin of each signal. The above image shows that the iron plate signal has a value of 5 in a constant combinator. This is very useful if the blueprint contains multiple buildings with many different parameters. If there are two different signals with the same value, or multiple sources of the same signal, that value or signal is treated as a single parameter.\nThere are several ways we can play with the values of the combinator. In order to be able to be modified, the \"Parameter\" checkbox next to a signal or value must be ticked. Further, these parameters can be reordered by clicking and dragging the bars on the far right. Reordering does play an important part in more advanced uses.\nIn the above image, the iron and copper icons have been replaced with special parameter icons. These signals can be chosen upon building the blueprint. Whatever signals are chosen will inherit the original signal values of 5 and 10, respectively. Each parameter can be given a name, which will show up when building the blueprint. This is optional, but recommended.\nClicking \"Ingredient of\" will allow us to select a parameter icon of an above parameter icon. This is why the order of the parameters is important. In our example, if Parameter 0 is set to, say,\nsteel plate\n, Parameter 1 will automatically set itself to whatever the ingredient of that item is: in this case,\niron plate\n. It is important to have enough available parameters for the number of ingredients. If we were to set Parameter 0 to instead\nelectronic circuit\n, Parameter 1 would do nothing, as there are two ingredients to that item. A parameter will always choose the default recipe of an item as listed in the Factoriopedia. Alternate recipes such as those added in\nSpace Age\nwill not be considered.\nA parameter that is a constant can set as a parameter, and given an optional variable. In the above image, the Iron Value of 5 has been set as a parameter, which will be set separately from the signal itself.\nGiving a constant an optional variable allows itself to be used in a formula for a later constant. In the above image, the Copper Value of 10 has been set as a parameter, and given the variable \"x\". The variable can be anything, but it's best to keep it as something simple. Further, our \"A Value\" value of 1 is selected as a parameter, and the formula box is checked.\nThere are several formulas available. Hovering the mouse over the formula box will show a list of available formulas given the current blueprint. In this example, the \"A Value\" constant can be set based on the stack size or rocket capacity of whatever Parameter 0 or 1 comes out to be. We can also use our variable \"x\" from above. We can type in basic mathematical operators like +, -, *, and /. This example uses the formula \"x*2\", meaning the A Value constant will be set to double whatever variable \"x\" turns out to be.\nOnce finished configuring it, we press the green button, which saves our settings. The blueprint can now be placed. With our example, doing so will bring up the following box.\nWe are given options to configure both the original iron plate signal, and the value of the copper plate signal. The other signals are determined by what we input in these two boxes. This example goes with a steel plate and a value of 8. Building this will give the following result.\nOur original iron plate signal is now steel plate, with its original value of 5.\nOur original copper plate signal is now iron plate with a value of 8, as that is the sole ingredient of steel plates\nOur \"A\" signal has stayed the same, but its value is now 16, which is double the variable \"x\", which we set to be 8\nNormally, the purple parameter icons are only available in the parameterisation GUI. Alternatively, if the \"show parameters in selection lists\" option is enabled under game Setting > Interface > Interaction, parameters 0 through 9 become available as\nvirtual signals\nunder the \"Unsorted\" tab to expedite the process of setting up a parameterised blueprint.\nImporting/Exporting blueprints\nIt is possible to export blueprints as a text string and import said text string to create a new blueprint. This makes sharing blueprints between players very easy.\nClicking the\nExport to string\nbutton (\n) in the top right of the blueprint edit window will pop up a window containing the\nBlueprint string\n. This string can be copied to the operating system clipboard, from where it could be saved to a text file or uploaded to a website.\nTo import a blueprint, the player can click the\nImport string\nicon on the\nshortcut bar\n(\n). A dialogue box will appear into which the string can be pasted. This will result in a blueprint appearing on the hand with the same setup as the one that was exported.\nThe text string itself is a base64 encoded, compressed JSON string which contains all the information of the blueprint. It is therefore possible to decode/decompress the text string, change attributes of the blueprint in the JSON text and finally re-encode/compress it back to the known text string format. This basically allows blueprint editing outside of the game itself.\nA complete explanation of the blueprint JSON can be found on the\nblueprint string format\npage.\nAdditional information\nOnce a blueprint is created, it can be used an unlimited amount of times.\nTo place a blueprint that is blocked by existing buildings, you can hold\nShift\nto place the objects that aren't blocked.\nThe above trick will also mark\nrocks\nand\ntrees\nfor deconstruction.\nBuildings marked for\ndestruction\nwill not block placing a blueprint. The blueprinted building cannot be placed if there are any buildings in the way. This can cause an item outside the construction zone to block construction of a 2×2 building on the edge of the zone.\nThe maximum of size a blueprint is 10k by 10k\ntiles\n.\nTrivia\nIn\nSpace Age\n, it is possible to get a\nquality\nblueprint by recycling them with\nquality modules\n.

Tiles or entities queued for deconstruction will be marked with a red 'X'. When within the range of\nconstruction robots\nthey will be removed by the robots and the resulting items stored in\nlogistic network\nchests or, when a\npersonal roboport\nis used, the player's inventory.\nGhosts\nwill be removed immediately. Anything marked for deconstruction will immediately stop functioning. Deconstruction orders can be cancelled prior to the removal of the target. The deconstruction planner can be used unfiltered (blank) to remove all entities or tiles within its selection area, or it can be filtered to specific targets.\nDeconstruction planners, just like\nblueprints\n, can be stored in a\nblueprint book\nor\nblueprint library\nto prevent them occupying inventory space or for organization or sharing purposes.\nContents\n1\nUsage\n1.1\nGetting a deconstruction planner\n1.2\nAccessing settings\n1.3\nDeleting a planner\n1.4\nUsing the deconstruction planner\n1.5\nEffects of deconstruction\n1.6\nCancelling deconstruction orders\n1.7\nUndo\n2\nValid targets\n2.1\nTiles\n2.2\nEnvironmental entities\n3\nConfiguration and filtering\n3.1\nBlank planner rules\n3.2\nFilter settings window\n3.3\nPrinciples of filtering\n3.4\nSetting and removing filters\n3.5\nEntities tab\n3.5.1\nTrees/rocks only toggle\n3.5.2\nSpecial items in the Unsorted section\n3.6\nTiles tab\n3.7\nExporting and importing with strings\n4\nAchievements\n5\nTrivia\n6\nHistory\n7\nSee also\nUsage\nGetting a deconstruction planner\nA planner can be obtained by:\nClicking the red deconstruction planner icon (\n) in the\nshortcut bar\n.

Alternatively, it can be dropped into the player's inventory for later use. Once in the inventory it can be pinned to a\nquickbar\nslot.\nAccessing settings\nThe planner must be in an inventory in order for its configuration to be changed. Settings can be accessed by clicking\nRight mouse button\non a planner's icon, either in the inventory or on a quickbar link.\nA full description of available settings and filters can be found under\nconfiguration and filtering\n.\nDeleting a planner\nA planner that has been stored in an inventory can be deleted by clicking the red trash-can icon labelled\nDestroy deconstruction planner\n(\n) in the top right of its settings window.\nCare should be taken when the planner has been configured as this operation is performed immediately without confirmation and cannot be undone.\nUsing the deconstruction planner\nWith a planner held in the hand the player can click-drag it (\nLeft mouse button\nis held down while moving the mouse) over existing structures and ghosts to mark them for deconstruction. A tooltip appears indicating what will be removed.\nThe planner can be used anywhere on the map where the player has\nradar\ncoverage (map view).\nOnce\nLeft mouse button\nis released the deconstruction planner will take effect according to the rules listed below.\nDragging a deconstruction planner.\nThe tooltip shows what will be removed.\nRed Xs indicate queued deconstruction orders. Ghosts were immediately removed.\nEffects of deconstruction\nThe following describes the possible results of using a deconstruction planner in the game world:\nAny selected entity ghosts and tile ghosts will be immediately removed.\nAny selected entities and tiles will be queued for deconstruction, indicated with a red X.\nAnything queued for deconstruction will stop functioning; for example\ntransport belts\nwill stop moving,\nassembling machines\nwill cease producing items,\nwalls\nstop connecting to each other, and so on. Laser and gun turrets will continue functioning even when marked for deconstruction.\nIf the deconstruction orders are within the construction area of construction robots the orders will be added to the bots' queue and will be removed in due course:\nBots will fly in and remove all entities and tiles and place the resulting items in logistic network chests, or the player's inventory when the bots flew from a personal roboport.\nWhere there are items to be removed - for example being carried by transport belts or stored inside a chest or assembling machine - these will also be picked up by bots and placed in the appropriate storage.\nItems must be removed before the entities that carry or hold them. For example if a\nwooden chest\nholding 500\niron plates\nis marked for removal, the plates will be picked up first and only when all have been removed will the bots deconstruct the chest itself.\nEnvironmental entities such as trees, rocks and fish are handled in the same way, except bots mine them and collect and store the resource items they leave behind.\nCliffs are a special case: they are destroyed by bots carrying\ncliff explosives\nand do not yield any item to be stored.\nCancelling deconstruction orders\nQueued deconstruction orders can be cancelled by holding\nSHIFT\nwhile click-dragging a deconstruction planner over the affected area.\nWhen\nSHIFT\nis held down the area selection border will change from red to blue to indicate cancellation mode is in effect.\nUndo\nThe undo tool can be used to revert the actions of a deconstruction planner. This applies both to pending deconstruction orders and completed removals.\nUndo is triggered by pressing\nCTRL\n+\nZ\n(on macOS:\nCommand\n+\nZ\n)\nPerforming an undo will cancel any queued removal orders (red Xs) that have not yet been actioned. Any ghosts that were removed will be immediately replaced. Where built entities and tiles have already been removed the undo will reinstate them in the form of new ghosts that can then be re-built by any construction robots in range.\nItems that were removed as part of the deconstruction - for example the inventory of chests or items carried by a transport belt - will not be restored by an undo. This means that a deconstruction that consisted exclusively of items, for example picking up\nstone\nfrom the ground, cannot be undone.\nIt is also not possible to undo the removal of trees, rocks, cliffs and fish.\nCancelling deconstruction orders by dragging with\nShift\nheld down. The entities start working when the deconstruction is cancelled.\nUsing then undoing a deconstruction planner. Deconstruction markers are cancelled, ghosts re-appear, and removed entities are reinstated as new ghosts for bot rebuilding.\nValid targets\nHarvesting fish with a deconstruction planner.\nThe deconstruction planner can remove player-built entities,\nentity ghosts\n, tiles,\ntile ghosts\nand loose items. In addition, it can remove\ntrees\n,\nrocks\n,\ncliffs\nand\nfish\n.\nTiles\nTiles\nare treated differently to entities, entity ghosts and tile ghosts. By default a deconstruction planner will not select any tiles unless the area selected contains\nonly\ntiles; whenever one or more entities, entity ghosts or tile ghosts is included, tile selection is disabled. This is done to allow the player to use a deconstruction planner to remove entities that are placed on top of path tiles (such as\nconcrete\n) without the floor always being removed as well.\nWhen the user wishes to select tiles in areas where other objects also exist the deconstruction planner configuration must be changed as described in the next section.\nEnvironmental entities\nThese are handled in the same way as entities and tiles placed by the player: they are marked with a red X and construction robots will remove them. A difference with environmental entities is that bots will collect resources rather than the entity itself, such as\nwood\nfrom trees and stone from rocks.\nThe removal of cliffs requires that the bots have access to cliff explosives. Cliffs do not leave behind any resource.\nThe ability to use a deconstruction planner to remove and collect fish provides a convenient way for a player equipped with a\npersonal roboport\nto replenish their stocks of healing items even in the middle of combat. Fish marked with a deconstruction planner will stop moving.\nConfiguration and filtering\nAn example of a filtered planner icon.\nA new deconstruction planner is blank, meaning it removes according to a pre-defined set of rules. The planner can optionally be edited to provide a custom list of removal rules which control which types of entities and tiles will - or won't - be removed. These rules are called filters.\nA filtered planner will show its filtered items on its icon. Up to the first four filters will be shown.\nBlank planner rules\nA blank planner will select:\nAny entities and entity ghosts, including trees, rocks, cliffs and fish;\nTile ghosts;\nOr\n, if and only if no entities, entity ghosts and tile ghosts are found, it will instead select tiles.\nThese rules are the base point from which a filtered planner can then be customized.\nFilter settings window\nThe deconstruction planner interface is divided into two sections:\nentities\nand\ntiles\n.\nThe entities tab.\nThe tiles tab.\nA whitelist filter that removes only defensive structures.\nA blacklist filter that removes everything except\nroboports\nand\npower poles\n.\nPrinciples of filtering\nEach tab consists of 30 slots in which an entity or tile can be chosen. When one or more slots is filled the planner becomes filtered and will now act according to those filters.\nA set of filters is either a whitelist or blacklist, and this is set with a toggle at the top of each tab. The default is whitelist. In whitelist mode the planner will act only upon those items added to the filter slots - any entities and tiles not added as filters will be ignored by the planner.\nIn blacklist mode the opposite applies: the planner will mark everything\nexcept\nthe entities or tiles filtered on.\nSetting and removing filters\nClicking any slot with\nLeft mouse button\nwill open the\nSet the filter\nwindow in which the desired item can be chosen. Alternatively, an item in the hand can be clicked into a slot to filter on that item.\nA filter is removed by clicking on a filled slot with\nRight mouse button\n.\nEntities tab\nIn the entities tab the user can select items to filter from the follow categories:\nEnvironment\nLogistics\nProduction\nCombat\nUnsorted\nThe Environment tab lists all types of trees and rocks, plus cliffs and fish.\nLogistics, production and combat will be familiar to the player from the\nitem selection\nwindow. Environment and unsorted are unique to the deconstruction planner.\nThe environment tab lists cliffs, fish, and every individual kind of tree and rock. This facilitates filtering on specific environmental entities if desired.\nTrees/rocks only toggle\nAt the top of the entities tab is the\nTrees/rocks only\ntick-box. With this enabled the deconstruction planner will filter on all kinds of trees and rocks from the Environment section, and the filter slots will be disabled. The Whitelist/Blacklist toggle is still in effect and controls whether the planner selects only trees and rocks, or selects everything but them. Fish and cliffs are\nnot\nincluded in this filter.\nSpecial items in the Unsorted section\nThe unsorted section provides four special items, each using a red X icon.\nEntity ghost: To filter on any type of entity ghost, separate from constructed entities.\nItem on ground: Loose items on the ground, such as dropped by the player, spilled from removing\narmor\n, and stones dropped from destroyed\nrocks\n. Does not include items on\ntransport belts\n.\nItem request slot: Filters on the pending addition of items such as\nmodules\nto\nassembling machine 2\nor\nelectric furnace\n. This would also target\nfuel\nqueued for addition to a\nlocomotive\n. Does not target items already installed, only those waiting to be added following the placement of a blueprint or as a result of an undo operation.\nTile ghost: As with entity ghost, this will target\ntile\nghosts separately from constructed tiles. If the user wants a deconstruction planner that only removes tile ghosts, they can place this item as an entity filter. If they want a filter that removes all types of tiles and tile ghosts, they should add\nTile ghost\nunder Entities and then set the Tiles tab drop-down to 'Always'.\nTiles tab\nClicking a filter slot will bring up the\nSet the Filter\nwindow showing the available tiles.\nLandfill\nis included in the list but the only function is to exclusively select landfill ghosts, as landfill cannot be removed once placed.\nAt the top of the Tiles tab is a drop-down that controls constructed tile removal behavior. It has four options:\nNormal: The default. Constructed tiles are removed only when no entities, entity ghosts or tiles ghosts are found in the deconstruction area.\nAlways: Constructed tiles are always removed, even if the deconstruction planner also selects entities or entity ghosts. Tile ghosts are not selected unless\nTile ghost\nis added under the Entities tab.\nNever: Constructed tiles are never removed, even if they are the only object selected. Tile ghosts are not selected unless\nTile ghost\nis added in the Entities tab.\nOnly: Constructed tiles are always removed, and nothing else will be. Entities, entity ghosts and tile ghosts will be ignored. The Entities tab is effectively disabled when this mode is selected.\nThe deconstruction planner always follows the settings of this drop-down, regardless of any filters set in the Tiles tab. For example if a user wishes to configure a planner that removes both walls and\nconcrete\n, they must first set those filters in the Entities and Tiles tabs, and then also set the Tiles drop-down to\nAlways\n. Without changing the drop-down the planner would only select concrete in places where no entities, entity ghosts or tile ghosts were found, as per the rules described under Normal in the above list.\nExporting and importing with strings\nThe settings for a deconstruction planner can be exported in string form.\nClicking the\nExport to string\nbutton (\n) in the top right of the planner edit window will pop up a window containing the\nDeconstruction item string\n. This string can be copied to the operating system clipboard, from where it could be saved to a text file or uploaded to a website.\nTo import a deconstruction planner the player can click the\nImport String\nicon on the\nshortcut bar\n(\n). A dialogue box will appear into which the string can be pasted. This will result in a deconstruction planner appearing on the hand with the same configuration as the one that was exported.\nThe export/import process can be used to copy deconstruction planners between games and to other players.\nAchievements\nAutomated cleanup\nDeconstruct 100 objects with the\nconstruction robots\n.\nTrivia\nIn\nSpace Age\n, it is possible to get a\nquality\ndeconstruction planner by recycling them with\nquality modules\n.

    "content": "Upgrade planner\nEdit\nUsing an unfiltered upgrade planner.\nStack size\n1\nPrototype type\nupgrade-item\nInternal name\nupgrade-planner\nThe\nupgrade planner\nis a tool for mass updating entities to alternative entities of the same size and type. It can be used on both placed structures and\nghosts\n. It can also modify the contents of a\nblueprint\n. While most commonly used to upgrade entities to their higher tier equivalents - for example to replace\ntransport belts\nwith\nfast transport belts\nor\nfast inserters\nwith\nbulk inserters\n- the upgrade planner is able to change a wide range of entities including\ntransport belts\n,\nunderground belts\n,\nsplitters\n,\ninserters\n,\nassembling machines\n,\nchests\n,\npower poles\n,\nrail signals\n,\nmodules\n,\nfurnaces\nand more.\nUsing an upgrade planner in the game world is similar to the operation of the\ndeconstruction planner\nand blueprint, in that the player drags a rectangular area in which the upgrade planner will function and this results in orders being queued for\nconstruction robots\n. Upgrade planners can be used blank (unfiltered) to automatically apply a limited set of common upgrades. Alternatively they can be configured (filtered) to make specific replacements. This can include downgrading higher tier, later-game entities to lower tier equivalents.\nUpgrade planners, just like\nblueprints\n, can be stored in a\nblueprint book\nor\nblueprint library\nto prevent them occupying inventory space or for organization or sharing purposes.\nContents\n1\nBasic operation\n1.1\nGetting an upgrade planner\n1.2\nUsing a planner in the game world\n1.3\nCancelling updates\n1.4\nUpdating blueprints\n2\nUpgrade planner filters\n2.1\nUsing a blank upgrade planner (unfiltered)\n2.2\nFiltering an upgrade planner\n2.2.1\nThe filter window\n2.2.2\nEditing the filters\n3\nValid entities\n3.1\nModded entities\n4\nTrivia\n5\nHistory\n6\nSee also\nBasic operation\nGetting an upgrade planner\nA blank planner can be obtained by clicking the green upgrade planner icon (\n) on the\nshortcut bar\n(available once\nconstruction robotics\nhas been researched in at least one game.)\nThis will result in a blank upgrade planner appearing in the hand. It can be used immediately or placed in the inventory. It must be placed in the inventory before a filter can be applied and before it can be pinned to a\nquickbar\nslot.\nUsing a planner in the game world\nWith a planner held in the hand the player can click-drag it (\nLeft mouse button\nis held down while moving the mouse) over existing structures to mark them for upgrade. A tooltip appears indicating which entities will be changed and to what.\nOnce\nLeft mouse button\nis released yellow circles will appear over any existing structures that are now queued for update. These update operations will be performed by\nconstruction robots\n.\nThe planner can be used anywhere on the map where the player has\nradar\ncoverage (map view). Upgrade planners can also affect ghost entities. Any ghost eligible for update will immediately change to the new entity.\nDragging an upgrade planner.\nThe tooltip shows which upgrades will occur.\nYellow circles indicate pending update operations.\nGhost entities update immediately.\nCancelling updates\nPending upgrade operations can be cancelled by holding\nSHIFT\nwhile click-dragging the upgrade planner over the affected area.\nUpdating blueprints\nUpgrade planners can also be used to change the contents of a blueprint. This allows the player to keep using the same blueprints as they research progressively better entities. As upgrade planners can also downgrade entities this further provides a way for a player to adjust late-game blueprints to make them suitable for re-use in subsequent games.\nThe blueprint to be updated must reside in an inventory. It is not currently possible to use an upgrade planner in the blueprint library.\nWith a planner held in the hand, the edit window for a blueprint should be opened by clicking\nRight mouse button\non it.\nThe upgrade planner can be applied by clicking\nLeft mouse button\non the grey upgrade planner slot in the top right corner of the blueprint.\nThe entities in the blueprint will immediately update according to the filters in the planner. If a blank planner is used an automatic set of common upgrades is applied, as described in the next section.\nThe update is immediate and cannot be undone, except by applying another upgrade planner with filters set to change back the affected entities.\nUpgrade planner filters\nA new upgrade planner is blank, meaning it lacks any configuration and will operate on a pre-defined set of upgrade rules. The planner can optionally be edited to provide a custom list of update rules that control which entities will be updated and what to.\nUsing a blank upgrade planner (unfiltered)\nWhen a blank upgrade planner is used it operates on a specific list of entities considered automatically upgradable to the next highest tier. The list of entity types that can be affected by a blank planner are as follows:\nBelts\nUnderground belts\nSplitters\nInserters\nAssembling machines\nFurnaces\nEntities of the above types will be upgraded to the next highest tier where one exists. A complete list of the entities eligible for upgrade by a blank planner is found in\nValid entities\n.\nFiltering an upgrade planner\nThe planner must be in an inventory in order for it to be editable.

This brings up the\nSelect upgrade\nwindow. This is similar to the\nitem selection\nwindow but is limited to displaying the entities an upgrade planner is able to change.\nThe right-hand slot is then selected in the same way, choosing the target entity. The select upgrade window for the right slot will only show entities that are a valid update target for the entity in the left slot.\nWhen there is only one possible update target the right slot will be filled in automatically.\nFilters can be removed by clicking\nRight mouse button\non the slot.\nValid entities\nAn example of downgrading. This could be helpful to make a blueprint usable from the beginning of a game.\nThe upgrade planner can operate on the entities listed below. It can swap any entity in a given category to any other entity in the same category. For example a\ntransport belt\ncan be changed to a\nfast\nor\nexpress transport belt\nand also to any kind of\nunderground belt\n, but not to a\nsplitter\nor a\nchest\n.\nThe\nBlank upgrade planner\ncolumn indicates which entities will be automatically upgraded when a blank (unfiltered) upgrade planner is used.

Any book or blueprint, even nested one, can also be placed in the\nquickbar\n, but it is just a \"shortcut\", the item itself stays wherever it was.

It has two water connectors on opposite ends and passes water through to adjacent equipment such as other boilers. The boiler features a single output for the steam it produces. It only consumes fuel as it creates steam. Boilers used in conjunction with\noffshore pumps\nand steam engines are a vital part of early\npower generation\n.\nFor each unit of water, 10 units of steam are produced. Inserting one\ncoal\n(4 MJ) into a boiler then using the resulting steam in a steam engine will supply 4 MJ of energy to an electrical system. It costs 300 kJ to heat 1 unit of water to into 10 steam at 165°C, so one boiler will produce 60 steam per second.\nInserters\ncan insert fuel into boilers. However, using powered inserters to move fuel into a boiler can be problematic should fuel become unavailable: if no power is being produced, then powered inserters fueling a boiler cannot operate. Using at least one\nburner inserter\n, which uses fuel and not electricity, ensures that at least one inserter is available to restart a single boiler.

On a planet, the power output varies based on the\ntime of day\n. During the day (half of a day/night cycle), all panels provide a constant, maximum power level. Generated power will increase/decrease linearly during dawn and dusk, and no power is produced at night.\nThe baseline power generated by a panel is 60 kW; this represents 100% power production.\nOn\nNauvis\n, one solar panel produces an average of 42 kW over a day/night cycle.\nIn\nSpace Age\n, different planets provide a bonus or penalty to panel output. These modifiers are based on 60 kW as the baseline 100% power of a panel. Planets also have their own day/night cycle lengths, so the average power produced by panels over a day/night cycle can change.\nSpace platforms\ndo not have day/night cycles; panels produce a constant amount of power while at a location in space. If a platform is moving between locations, the power output will raise or lower based on how far it is between the source location and destination. If the source location offers 200% solar power, and the destination has 300%, then a platform halfway between will have its solar panels offer 250% power.\nQuality\npanels also provide higher than 100% power output.\nContents\n1\nEnergy management\n2\nNotes\n3\nSpace Age\n4\nOptimal ratios\n5\nAchievements\n6\nGallery\n7\nHistory\n8\nSee also\nEnergy management\nAs already stated, solar panels produce energy only during the day, but you likely want your factory to run at night as well.\nAccumulators\ncan be charged up with solar panels during the day to power the base at night.\nAccumulators are not the only way to work with solar energy. Sometimes it is more economical to just avoid consuming energy at night. For example, if you power a bunch of\nelectric mining drills\nand\nelectric furnaces\nto produce\niron\nand\ncopper plates\n, you could build more drills and furnaces than you actually need, and store the excess metal production during the day. At night you can shut down the drills and furnaces, and let your factory run with the stored plates. Instead of storing energy, you would be storing what the energy is used for. The easiest way to achieve this is by connecting all your extractors and furnaces to an electric network with exactly enough solar panels to make them work during the day, and keeping this network away from your factory's main electric network.\nNotes\nA single (normal quality) solar panel outputs an average of 42 kW over a day on\nNauvis\nand requires 0.84672 accumulators to sustain a constant power output through the night.\nIt takes approximately 23.8 solar panels to operate 1 MW of factory\nand\ncharge 20.2 accumulators to sustain that 1 MW through the night.\nThe optimal ratio for normal quality solar panels to charge enough normal quality accumulators on Nauvis is 2646 accumulators for 3125 solar panels (supplying 42 kW per solar panel).\nSolar efficiency graph over time.\n(click to enlarge)\nSpace Age\nIn Space Age, the closer a planet is to the sun, the more power a solar panel on its surface produces.

If the power usage of one device exceeds production for a few seconds or so, the accumulator can provide power to the grid until said device shuts down or requires a lesser power requirement.\nOther uses\nNote that if throughput should not be limited, a\npower switch\ncan be used instead.\nIsolation of Power Networks\nAccumulators\ncan be used to isolate two separate power networks, which has a number of uses. Since accumulators have a lower delivery priority than any other entity, this guarantees that they only receive energy when you have enough left over after powering all other entities in a network. At the same time, accumulators can also be used to deliver energy in another electrical network, and can charge and discharge at the same time. Consider the following example:\nExample of accumulators sharing two separate networks.\n(Click to enlarge)\nThe two power networks A and B are not directly connected to each other: They are connected only through the accumulators, which are shared by both networks. This is accomplished by setting up electric poles for each network connected to the accumulators, then ensuring the sets of poles are not connected to each other (which can be done by crafting a copper wire then dragging it between two connected poles to sever the connection, exactly as is done for disconnecting circuit wires). (As of 2.0, rather than crafted copper wire, the Make Copper Wire create tool in the UI -- near the Red & Green circuit wires -- is used.)\nIn the above example:\nThe accumulators will only charge if extra power is being produced by network A or B.\nThe accumulators will discharge as needed into either network if one is not producing enough power.\nSince the maximum input/output rate of an accumulator is 300 kW, power flow between the two networks will be limited to 300 kW times the number of accumulators (1.5 MW in the example).\nNote that this isolation is bidirectional: Either network can charge the accumulators, and the accumulators can discharge into either network.\nThis technique can be used whenever this type of isolation is desired.\nReduction of Energy Consumption in Critical Situations\nIn particular, one good use for the above technique is to limit electricity consumption in low power situations by isolating non-critical parts of your factory (such as\nRadar\n,\nLabs\n,\nElectric furnaces\n,\nelectric miners\n,\nBeacons\n, etc.) from critical parts (such as lasers, ammo production, or whatever your priorities are).\nTo do this, place your main generators and critical components on one network and place your non-critical components on another network, isolating the two as above. Now, two things will happen:\nPower will\nonly\nflow to the non-critical network when you are generating a surplus on the main network, and\nThe rate will always be limited to 300 kW per accumulator.\nBecause the accumulators will only receive power if you have a surplus on the main network, this will in effect deactivate the low-priority network when electricity is in short supply. This will also limit power consumption of the low priority network if its usage becomes high, for example if you have two factories on a low priority network and usually only one of them runs at a time, if both happen to run they won't consume more than the total limit, they'll just slow down.\nEssentially you are saying \"only deliver power to these systems if I have enough to spare, and even then don't exceed this delivery rate\".\nIn general this is a technique which works well when you've just researched accumulators and solar panels, but don't have enough resources to build big solar farms and accumulator farms yet.\n0.13.3\n:\nReduced collision box of\nbig electric pole\nto allow squeezing between it and an accumulator.\n0.13.0\n:\nNow connectible to the\ncircuit network\n.\n0.12.0\n:\nHeavy optimisations by merging them into groups.\n0.11.0\n:\nDrastically slowed crafting to 10 secs.\n0.7.1\n:\nCapacity doubled, increase I/O to 300 watts.\n0.4.1\n:\nAdded charging animation.\n0.4.0\n:\nIntroduced\nElectric system\nSolar panel\nPower production\nGame-day\nProduction items\nTools\nRepair pack\nBlueprint\nDeconstruction planner\nUpgrade planner\nBlueprint book\nElectricity\nBoiler\nSteam engine\nSolar panel\nAccumulator\nNuclear reactor\nHeat pipe\nHeat exchanger\nSteam turbine\nFusion reactor\n(\n)\nFusion generator\n(\n)\nResource extraction\nBurner mining drill\nElectric mining drill\nBig mining drill\n(\n)\nOffshore pump\nPumpjack\nFurnaces\nStone furnace\nSteel furnace\nElectric furnace\nFoundry\n(\n)\nRecycler\n(\n)\nAgriculture\nAgricultural tower\nBiochamber\nCaptive biter spawner\nProduction\nAssembling machine 1\nAssembling machine 2\nAssembling machine 3\nOil refinery\nChemical plant\nCentrifuge\nElectromagnetic plant\n(\n)\nCryogenic plant\n(\n)\nLab\nBiolab\n(\n)\nEnvironmental protection\nLightning rod\nLightning collector\nHeating tower\nModules\nBeacon\nSpeed module\nSpeed module 2\nSpeed module 3\nEfficiency module\nEfficiency module 2\nEfficiency module 3\nProductivity module\nProductivity module 2\nProductivity module 3\nQuality module\n(\n)\nQuality module 2\n(\n)\nQuality module 3\n(\n)\nNavigation\nLogistics\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Accumulator&oldid=213964\n\"",

The heat can be used in a\nheat exchanger\nto produce steam which can be used to generate power. Unlike other forms of power generation, it is load-independent – each fuel cell will always be used completely in 200 seconds, regardless of load or the temperature of the reactor. To prevent wasting fuel, the\ninserters\nfeeding fuel to the reactors can read the heat level of a reactor via the\ncircuit network\n, permitting them to only insert when the heat in the reactor is relatively low. Alternatively, excess power can be stored in\naccumulators\nor as steam in\nstorage tanks\n.\nInstead of completely consuming the fuel, burning fuel in a nuclear reactor results in\ndepleted uranium fuel cells\n. These used up cells can be\nreprocessed\nin a\ncentrifuge\nto get back some of the uranium used to create the fuel cells. The reactor will not burn more fuel if it has too many depleted fuel cells, so they must be removed.\nNuclear reactors have a heat capacity of 10 MJ/°C. Thus, they can buffer 5 GJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, and require 4.85 GJ of energy to warm up from 15°C to 500°C when initially placed.\nContents\n1\nNeighbour bonus\n1.1\nDouble-row layout\n1.2\nSquare layout\n2\nExplosion\n3\nHistory\n4\nSee also\nNeighbour bonus\nReactors receive a bonus for adjacent operating reactors, which increases their effective thermal output by 100% per each such link. For example, two reactors operating next to each other will output a total of 160 MW of thermal energy, with each reactor producing 40 MW base and receiving 40 MW of neighbour bonus.\nThe Neighbour bonus only applies if:\n2 reactors are directly adjacent to each other with all 3 heat connections directly connecting the two.\nBoth reactors are fueled.\nDouble-row layout\nThe most efficient practical layout is an aligned double row of arbitrary length (number of reactors as needed). For even numbers of reactors, the total output of the array is\n160n − 160 MW\n(where\nn\n= total number of reactors, and assuming all are fueled). Splitting the row, while possibly logistically beneficial, reduces total power output by 160 MW per split.\nOdd numbers of reactors are inefficient in maximizing the bonus, but, if needed, the odd reactor should be aligned with one of the rows. Offsetting the longer row instead would not gain the extra reactor any bonus, while the reactor on the other end of the same row would lose its bonus as well. Placing the odd reactor between the ends of aligned rows would also lead to one fewer bonus, and also make the design un-tileable.\nIn any case however, such concerns are unlikely to arise until one has a very large base, as the individual output of reactors is massive, particularly with neighbour bonuses. As an example, a 5×2 reactor grid would produce 1,440 MW (1.44 GW), the equivalent of 1,600 steam engines, or 24,000 solar panels.\nSquare layout\nTheoretically, a perfectly square grid of reactors with no spaces between would provide maximum bonus, as it minimizes the number of reactors with unlinked sides. This setup produces\n200n − 160×sqrt(n) MW\n(where\nsqrt(n)\nis the square root of the number of reactors).\nHowever, while the heat pipe links will allow energy flow from reactors within the square, with no room around inner reactors, there will be no way to insert and remove fuel cells except manually (heat pipes are traversable by the player), which makes this setup impractical.\nFurthermore, the gains compared to the double-row design are not large. After some calculation, one arrives at the expression for the ratio of the two (double-row design in denominator) as\n(1.25n − sqrt(n)) ÷ (n − 1)\nwhich evaluates to, for example, 1 for 4 reactors, 1.07 for 16 reactors, 1.16 for 100 reactors (considering only numbers that both an equal-length double row and a square can be built from), and so on. In the limit (infinite number of reactors), the ratio approaches 1.25 as the edge corrections become insignificant.\nExplosion\nIf a reactor is destroyed (by damage) while it is above 900°C, it will explode just like an\natomic bomb\n. This explosion has enough power to destroy other reactors, so one explosion can lead to a chain reaction of exploding reactors. 0.18.0\n:\nUpdated sound effects.\n0.17.67\n:\nHeat pipes (also in reactors and heat exchangers) glow with high temperatures.\n0.16.0\n:\nChanged nuclear reactor stack size to 10.\n0.15.0\n:\nIntroduced\nPower production\nHeat pipe\nSteam turbine\nComprehensive guide on nuclear power\nProduction items\nTools\nRepair pack\nBlueprint\nDeconstruction planner\nUpgrade planner\nBlueprint book\nElectricity\nBoiler\nSteam engine\nSolar panel\nAccumulator\nNuclear reactor\nHeat pipe\nHeat exchanger\nSteam turbine\nFusion reactor\n(\n)\nFusion generator\n(\n)\nResource extraction\nBurner mining drill\nElectric mining drill\nBig mining drill\n(\n)\nOffshore pump\nPumpjack\nFurnaces\nStone furnace\nSteel furnace\nElectric furnace\nFoundry\n(\n)\nRecycler\n(\n)\nAgriculture\nAgricultural tower\nBiochamber\nCaptive biter spawner\nProduction\nAssembling machine 1\nAssembling machine 2\nAssembling machine 3\nOil refinery\nChemical plant\nCentrifuge\nElectromagnetic plant\n(\n)\nCryogenic plant\n(\n)\nLab\nBiolab\n(\n)\nEnvironmental protection\nLightning rod\nLightning collector\nHeating tower\nModules\nBeacon\nSpeed module\nSpeed module 2\nSpeed module 3\nEfficiency module\nEfficiency module 2\nEfficiency module 3\nProductivity module\nProductivity module 2\nProductivity module 3\nQuality module\n(\n)\nQuality module 2\n(\n)\nQuality module 3\n(\n)\nNavigation\nLogistics\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Nuclear_reactor&oldid=214002\n\"",

Currently, this is limited to\nheat exchangers\n,\nnuclear reactors\n, and\nheating towers\n.\nHeat pipes have a heat capacity of 1 MJ/°C. Thus, they can theoretically buffer 500 MJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, making them a space-efficient energy store. However, because temperature needs a drop of greater than 1 degree before it will \"flow,\" you can't raise them all the way to 1000°C or drain them all the way to 500°C, so the practical energy capacity will depend on the layout.\nAs heat pipes rise in temperature, they will give off a very low-distance glow.\nOn the planet\nAquilo\n, heat pipes are a necessity due to the freezing temperatures. If buildings are not adjacent to heat pipes (or similar objects) with a temperature of at least 30°C, the building will freeze and stop working.\nHeat pipe throughput\nEach heat pipe holds an amount of heat energy, and there is a limit to how much energy can go through each of them for a given duration.\nFor any heat pipe entity with one input connection on one side and one output connection on another, this entity will lower the temperature by\n1 + (P / 15) °C\nwith P being the power going through this entity expressed in MW.\nA\nheat exchanger\nmust heat up to 500°C before it can generate steam. And the maximum temperature of a heat generator (such as a nuclear reactor) is 1000°C. As such, the temperature difference between a heat source and the heat exchanger is at most 500°C. We can thus express the maximum length of a straight line of heat pipe as\n500 / (1 + P/15)\n.\nFor example let's take a single nuclear reactor outputting 40MW of heat power to a single line of heat pipes. The furthest that line can go is\n500 / (1 + 40/15)\nwhich is around 136 heat pipes long.\nA nuclear reactor can also be used to transfer heat in a similar manner as a heat pipe, whether or not it is fueled. In this case, the reactor will drop the temperature by\n1 + (P / 387) °C\n, with P again being the power in MW going through the entity. Note that this is an approximation, the actual value measured is supposed to be 200000/517 or about 386.847.\nThat being said, the nuclear reactor entity is also much bigger, meaning that we must compare it to 5 lines of 5 heat pipes instead of just a single one. The nuclear reactor will thus lower the temperature 5 times less with near-zero power going through it, and nearly 26 times less when approaching infinite power, compared to those lines of heat pipes.\nAs an example, a single line of 100 nuclear reactors (or 500 tiles) will only lower the temperature by about 360°C while carrying 1GW.\nIn\nSpace Age\n, on\nAquilo\n, heat pipes are used to prevent entities from\nfreezing\n. They automatically transfer heat into neighboring entities. Different entities consume different amounts of heat to prevent freezing, but they do not have the temperature requirements of a heat exchanger. Heat pipes only need to be at least 30°C to keep an entity warm. Also, heat pipes do not lose heat to the environment; they only lose heat to entities that need to be kept warm.\n0.17.67\n:\nHeat pipes (also in reactors and heat exchangers) glow with high temperatures.\n0.15.11\n:\nChanged heat transfer mechanics, prior to this heat would flow better following the order of heat pipe placement\n0.15.0\n:\nIntroduced\nPower production\nHeating tower\nHeat exchanger\nProduction items\nTools\nRepair pack\nBlueprint\nDeconstruction planner\nUpgrade planner\nBlueprint book\nElectricity\nBoiler\nSteam engine\nSolar panel\nAccumulator\nNuclear reactor\nHeat pipe\nHeat exchanger\nSteam turbine\nFusion reactor\n(\n)\nFusion generator\n(\n)\nResource extraction\nBurner mining drill\nElectric mining drill\nBig mining drill\n(\n)\nOffshore pump\nPumpjack\nFurnaces\nStone furnace\nSteel furnace\nElectric furnace\nFoundry\n(\n)\nRecycler\n(\n)\nAgriculture\nAgricultural tower\nBiochamber\nCaptive biter spawner\nProduction\nAssembling machine 1\nAssembling machine 2\nAssembling machine 3\nOil refinery\nChemical plant\nCentrifuge\nElectromagnetic plant\n(\n)\nCryogenic plant\n(\n)\nLab\nBiolab\n(\n)\nEnvironmental protection\nLightning rod\nLightning collector\nHeating tower\nModules\nBeacon\nSpeed module\nSpeed module 2\nSpeed module 3\nEfficiency module\nEfficiency module 2\nEfficiency module 3\nProductivity module\nProductivity module 2\nProductivity module 3\nQuality module\n(\n)\nQuality module 2\n(\n)\nQuality module 3\n(\n)\nNavigation\nLogistics\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Heat_pipe&oldid=213700\n\"",

The steam produced is exactly 500°C hot, even if the exchanger is hotter. Heat exchangers have a heat capacity of 1 MJ/°C. Thus, they can buffer 500 MJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, and require 485 MJ of energy to warm up from 15°C to 500°C when initially placed.\nCalculating steam production rate\nHeat exchangers produce 103 steam/second. This can be calculated by relying on\nsteam turbine\ndata: A steam turbine consumes 60 steam/second and produces 5.82MW (assuming 500°C steam). This means a single unit of 500°C steam has\n5.82MW / (60/s) = 0.097 MJ\nof energy. A heat exchanger produces 10 MJ a second, therefore it produces\n10MJ / 0.097MJ = 103.0927835\nsteam per second.\nThe steam production rate can also be calculated using the energy consumption: 1 heat exchanger consumes 10MW, so it's putting 10MJ of energy into heating water/steam per second. To heat up 1 unit of steam 1 degree, 200 joules are needed, so the heat exchanger is heating up water by 50,000 unit-°C in total. We observe that this heating results in a temperature increase from 15°C to 500°C, so an increase of 485°C. So the 50,000 unit-°C is divided among 103 units of steam per second, since\n50,000 / 485 = 103.09\n.

At this mode, the steam turbine acts equal to two separate\nsteam engines\n, producing 1800 kW and consuming 60 steam/sec. However, actual power production is based on the temperature of the steam, not the building itself. This means that using a steam turbine is no more fuel-efficient than using two steam engines.

It burns\nfuel\nto\nmine\nthe ore underneath the 2×2 area it is placed on.\nIt mines about 7 items per single unit of coal used to fuel it, producing 0.25 items/s for\ncopper ore\n,\ncoal\n,\niron ore\nor\nstone\n. Burner miners create a lot of\npollution\nper item.\nBurner drills are usually used until the player has built an\nelectrical network\n, at which point the larger and faster\nelectric mining drill\nbecomes more useful, though they can still provide some use as extra drills that take up less space.\nContents\n1\nInterface\n2\nSelf-Sustaining Coal Mines\n2.1\nMethod 1\n2.2\nMethod 2\n3\nHistory\n4\nSee also\nInterface\nAmount of\nfuel\nin the mining drill\nDepletion of 1 unit of\nfuel\nProgress of mining\nProduct\nSelf-Sustaining Coal Mines\nBoth methods require no electricity.\nMethod 1\nTwo burner mining drills can refuel each other when placed next to each other on a coal deposit as long as they're facing each other. Each drill fuels the other and coal gradually accumulates in their\nstacks\n, so you have effectively a storage of 100 coal (2 stacks, 50 coal, one in each burner miner, together 100). You can do this also for 4 or any other even number of miners.\nNote that it takes slightly less than 3 minutes for the mining drills to completely fill each other's fuel inventory. Once full, the drills will sit idle until the accumulated coal is removed. It's possible to extend that time by having the drills output their coal into a buffer\nchest\nrather than directly into another drill's fuel stack.\nMethod 2\nThis method can be used for any number of burner mining drills in a coal deposit. Place a burner mining drill, then place at least three\ntransport belts\nfrom the output in a mirrored \"L\" like shape so that the third belt has a gap between it and the miner. Fill the gap with a\nburner inserter\nin a way that the inserter can insert coal to the miner. When placing this array of entities opposite of each other, ensure that no two burner inserters are trying to take coal from the same piece of belt or one of them might run out of fuel.\nCopy blueprint string\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\n0.18.0\n:\nUpdated sound effects.\n0.17.0\n:\nMining speed for all ores except uranium is now 0.25/s.\n0.8.1\n:\nMining drill now ignores resources that can't be mined because of the higher hardness.\n0.8.0\n:\nPlayer starts with one burner mining drill and one furnace in the freeplay.\nIncreased mining speed of burner mining drill.\n0.7.3\n:\nShows area of effect when highlighted.\nMining drill evenly mines from every tile in it's area.\n0.7.0\n:\nAdded support for modules to Electric mining drills.\nMining drills deactivate when out of resources.\n0.5.1\n:\nShow output arrows when alt mode is on.\n0.5.0\n:\nNew Graphics.\n0.2.0\n:\nShows count of available resources.\n0.1.0\n:\nIntroduced\nMining\nCoal\nProduction items\nTools\nRepair pack\nBlueprint\nDeconstruction planner\nUpgrade planner\nBlueprint book\nElectricity\nBoiler\nSteam engine\nSolar panel\nAccumulator\nNuclear reactor\nHeat pipe\nHeat exchanger\nSteam turbine\nFusion reactor\n(\n)\nFusion generator\n(\n)\nResource extraction\nBurner mining drill\nElectric mining drill\nBig mining drill\n(\n)\nOffshore pump\nPumpjack\nFurnaces\nStone furnace\nSteel furnace\nElectric furnace\nFoundry\n(\n)\nRecycler\n(\n)\nAgriculture\nAgricultural tower\nBiochamber\nCaptive biter spawner\nProduction\nAssembling machine 1\nAssembling machine 2\nAssembling machine 3\nOil refinery\nChemical plant\nCentrifuge\nElectromagnetic plant\n(\n)\nCryogenic plant\n(\n)\nLab\nBiolab\n(\n)\nEnvironmental protection\nLightning rod\nLightning collector\nHeating tower\nModules\nBeacon\nSpeed module\nSpeed module 2\nSpeed module 3\nEfficiency module\nEfficiency module 2\nEfficiency module 3\nProductivity module\nProductivity module 2\nProductivity module 3\nQuality module\n(\n)\nQuality module 2\n(\n)\nQuality module 3\n(\n)\nNavigation\nLogistics\nIntermediate products\nSpace\n(\n)\nCombat\nTechnology\nEnvironment\nRetrieved from \"\nhttps://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Burner_mining_drill&oldid=212338\n\"",

Each field can be covered by only one pumpjack at a fixed spot. The pumpjack will then output an amount of fluid equal to 10 multiplied by the field's yield per second. For example, a field with 538% yield will generate 54 fluid per second. Without\nspeed modules\n, one pumpjack cycle takes one second to complete.\nExtracting fluid lowers the field's yield by 1% per 300 pumpjack cycles, to a minimum of 20% of the initial yield or 2 fluid per second, whichever is larger.\nThey are limited to a maximum output of 1000 fluid per cycle, achieved by a field with more than 9999% yield. However, such a high yield is rare with standard\nmap generator\nsettings.\nPumpjacks can only be placed on fluid resource field tiles. Furthermore, the output pipe location is fixed relative to the pumpjack's orientation.\nIn the base game, the only kind of resource field yields\ncrude oil\n. In\nSpace Age\n, the pumpjack can also extract\nsulfuric acid\nfrom\nVulcanus\n, as well as\nfluorine\nand\nlithium brine\nfrom\nAquilo\n.\nLithium brine resource fields are special; unlike the other resource fields, these can run out. These patches do not display a percentage; they instead report the total amount of fluid in the field. They also do not produce less fluid over time. A pumpjack will always produce the same amount of fluid per second on any lithium brine field until it is exhausted: 60 fluid per cycle.\nContents\n1\nTips\n2\nGallery\n3\nHistory\n4\nSee also\nTips\nA resource field that has depleted (to the minimum of 20%) can still make use of\nspeed modules\n, which are thus a good option for raising the pumpjack's output. With two\nspeed module 3s\n, the output doubles from 2 to 4 fluid per second. With two\nlegendary\nspeed module 3s, the output increases by a factor of 3.5 from 2 to 7 fluid per second.\nThe formula to determine the modified output is:\nOutput of unmodified pumpjack x (1 + number of modules in pumpjack x average module bonus + transmission strength x number of modules in each beacon x average module bonus)\nExample:\nFor a pumpjack on a depleted resource field with two level 3 speed modules and 4 beacons with each two level 3 speed modules:\n2 x (1 + 2 x 0.5 + √4 x 1.5 x 2 x 0.5) = 10 fluid per second.\nAssuming that there will be always two speed 3 modules equipped in the pumpjack and beacons, the formula for 4 beacons can be shortened:\n2 x (2 + √4 x 1.5) = 10 fluid per second.\nAdditionally, on an infinite resource well (such as oil) and barring the use of beacons, the best modules to place in a pumpjack are\nspeed modules\n. This does not depend on yield.\nAs an example: be two oil wells, W1 and W2, both with an initial yield of 1 000%. The first one is slotted with two normal\nquality\nproductivity module 3s\n, the second one with two normal quality\nspeed module 3s\n. Below is a table summing up the production of each well (amount produced per cycle is rounded up based on the first few lines of this page).\nTime (minutes)\nProduced (W1)\nYield (W1)\nProduced (W2)\nYield (W2)\n0\n0\n1000\n0\n1000\n1\n5040\n1000\n12000\n1000\n8\n40 320\n999\n96 000\n997\n72\n362 830\n990\n855 480\n972\n715\n3 440 959\n900\n7 392 240\n714\n2000\n8 718 394\n720\n14 510 400\n200\n5715\n17 422 423\n200\n23 426 400\n200\nHow to read (e.g. line 3): after both wells have been active for 8 minutes, W1 has produced 40 320 units of oil and its yield has decreased to 999%; W2 has produced 96 000 units of oil and its yield has decreased to 997%. W2 has produced more oil than W1 at every point in time. When W1 finally depletes to the minimum 20% of its original yield, it produces (yield x (1+productivity) x speed) oil per second, so 20 x 1.2 x 0.7 = 16.8 oil per second, while W2 produces 20 x 1 x 2 = 40 oil per second, so W2 also produces more when the well is depleted.\nSpeed modules are thus better from start to finish, even on a well with high initial yield. While there is a period when W1 produces more than W2 (because W2 depletes quicker), from ~1475 minutes to ~4428 minutes, W2 still has produced more in total than W1 at every point in this period. The closest they come is near minute 4428 (~74h), when W1 has produced 19 386 927 and W2 20 337 600. Then the gap increases again in favour of W2.\nYet higher yields do not change this figure, and e.g. a 5 000 starting yield has W1 and W2 come closest around 369h of operation, with W2 still 5% ahead in terms of total produced.\nThe difference is exacerbated by an increase in the quality of the modules: with legendary quality modules, the moment W1 depletes, it has produced 21 778 029 units of oil, while W2 has produced 33 713 400 (55% more). The difference in production from there onward is (W1) 20 x 1.5 x 0.7 = 21 to (W2) 20 x 1 x 3.5 = 70.\nIn conclusion: to maximize production of oil and in the absence of beacons, pumpjacks should be equipped with\nspeed modules\n. However, if at least two beacons are present that are slotted with tier 3 speed modules, some quick calculations seem to make tier 3 productivity modules best for the pumpjack, until mining productivity is researched, at which point speed is best.\nAnimation of different speeds of pumpjacks: one with two speed modules, one with no modules and one with two production modules.\n(Click to see GIF animation)\n0.15.0\n:\nPumpjacks can be turned on and off using the circuit network.

A beacon allows transmitting the effect of a module to multiple machines, and multiple beacons can affect the same machine, albeit with diminishing returns. Additionally, beacons can provide boosts beyond the normal limits of internal module slots.\nThe beacon emanates an electrical charge at a steady interval, the color changes depending on which modules are placed into the beacon, or if it contains none at all.\nContents\n1\nUsage\n2\nLimitations\n3\nTransmission strength\n4\nMaximum number per building\n5\nBeacon arrays\n5.1\nMulti-row arrays\n5.2\nOptimal arrays\n6\nHistory\n7\nSee also\nUsage\nBeacons are\nbest\nin these scenarios:\nThere are many compatible machines in a dense area\nThis allows the beacon's effect to reach multiple machines, allowing the player to save materials from crafting modules.\nThere is one machine that must have an extreme speed of operation\nMining drills present an example of this usefulness. When an ore patch is small but rich, more speed per drill is necessary to meet demand, since adding more drills isn't possible. So, multiple speed module beacons around a mining drill (with modules in the drill itself) can be used to increase the speed of the individual drill several times, to make up for the low quantity of drills.\nBeacons should\nnot\nbe used in these scenarios:\nThe machine(s) being boosted operate infrequently\nThis leads to power waste as beacons will always consume power, even when the machines they're boosting are halted. This however can be circumvented with some planning, and using a\npower switch\n.\nAttempting to boost non-module-compatible machines\nOnly machines that have module slots will be affected by a beacon.\nLimitations\nOnly buildings with module slots can benefit from beacon effects (i.e.\nlaser turret\ndoesn't benefit). The only exceptions to this rule are beacons themselves which\ndon't\nbenefit from the modules inserted in themselves (or other beacons), so their energy cost can't be reduced.\nCurrently, only\nspeed\nand\nefficiency\nmodules can be used in beacons, and\nproductivity\nand\nquality\nmodules cannot.\nMultiple beacons overlapping the same machine will have diminishing returns, so it's more efficient to surround buildings around beacons than surround beacons around buildings.\nTransmission strength\nThe effect of modules placed in beacons is not equal to those placed in the machines themselves. Rather, it is multiplied by a factor called \"transmission strength\". This factor is applied to all stats affected by the module, both good and bad.\nThe transmission strength itself depends on two factors. One is the distribution efficiency stat of the beacon; For normal beacons, this is always 1.5, but quality can increase it up to 2.5 for legendary beacons. The second factor is the reciprocal square root of the number of beacons affecting each machine. Therefore, in total,\nn\nnormal quality beacons affecting the same machine will have a combined transmission strength of\n1.5 x n^0.5\n.\nIn practical terms, this means that there are diminishing returns on increasing the number of beacons affecting the same machine, as the effect per beacon decreases when more are added.\nMaximum number per building\nThe maximum number of beacons that can be built in range of a building depend on that building's footprint:\nBuildings from 2×2 to 4×4 size:\n12 beacons\n, with an effect of 3.46 times that of a single beacon.\nBuildings from 5×5 to 7x7 size:\n16 beacons\n, with an effect of 4 times that of a single beacon.\nBuildings from 8x8 to 10x10 size:\n20 beacons\n, with an effect of 4.47 times that of a single beacon.\nIt should be noted that, because the space between a beacon and a machine can not be greater than two tiles without putting the machine outside of the beacon's range, belt routing can become a challenge. In some situations, use of the logistic network may be required in order to supply the machines.\nThe maximum number of beacons that can be built in range of a row of buildings:\nRow of 3×3 buidings:\n8 beacons\n, with an effect of 2.83 times that of a single beacon.\nRow of 5×5 buidings:\n10 beacons\n, with an effect of 3.16 times that of a single beacon.\nNote that when buildings and beacons are arranged in parallel rows like this, the offset between buildings and beacons along the direction of the rows is important. For example, imagine placing a row of\nassembling machine 3s\nbetween two rows of beacons. If the sides of the beacons and the assembling machines line up, every assembling machine is affected by six beacons in total. Howevever, if either the beacons or the assembling machines are shifted by one tile relative to the other, then each assembling machine is affected by eight beacons in total.\nIn general, depending on the width of the machines modulo 3:\nIf the width of the machines is divisible by three, then the arrangement is optimal when the sides of a machine do not align with the sides of a beacon on the axis perpendicular to the direction of the rows.\nIf the width of the machines modulo 3 is 1 (such as a width of 4), then any offset leads to an optimal layout.\nIf the width of the machines modulo 3 is 2 (such as a width of 5), then the arrangement is optimal when the center of a machine aligns with the center of a beacon on the axis perpendicular to the direction of the rows. Note that this requires a one-tile gap between the machines.\nBeacon arrays\nBeacons can boost the overall capabilities of a factory quite significantly. However, they consume a considerable amount of power (480 kW apiece), take up nontrivial space, complicate logistics, and also are relatively expensive to craft. Therefore, when building an entire production line with a high beacon boost, it is significantly more economical to build a row of production buildings surrounded by row(s) of beacons, rather than single buildings surrounded by the maximum number of beacons theoretically possible. This also simplifies logistics and makes the design more tiling-friendly.\nThe maximum possible benefits are reduced somewhat in row-array configuration (for 3×3 buildings, 8 beacons per building are possible instead of 12; for 5×5 buildings, 10 instead of 16), but the number of beacons required to achieve this boost level is considerably lower. For example, for a single row of 3×3 buildings surrounded by a double row of beacons so that each production building is in range of 8 beacons, the total number of beacons required is\n2n + 6\n, where\nn\nis the number of production buildings.\nThe average number of beacons per building is then\n2 + (6 ÷ n)\n, which tends toward 2 (i.e., a 75% reduction in the number of beacons needed compared to isolated buildings with 8 distinct beacons each) when\nn\ngoes to infinity. For e.g.\nn\n= 10 the formula evaluates to 2.6, which is still a reduction of 67.5% in beacons needed.\nMulti-row arrays\nFor large numbers of buildings to be boosted, efficiency can be further improved by separating production buildings into multiple rows. In this case, the beacons in all but the edge rows of the array can be shared by the two rows of production buildings on either side. (Note that it does not matter if these are producing different recipes and / or are different buildings altogether.) The total number of beacons required, assuming 3×3 sized production buildings and rows of equal length, is\nB(r,c) = (r + 1)(c + 3) = rc + 3r + c + 3\n, where\nr\nis the number of rows of production buildings and\nc\nis the number of production buildings in a single row.\nThe number of beacons per boosted building is then\n(3 ÷ rc) + (1 ÷ r) + (3 ÷ c) + 1\n, which tends to 1 as both\nr\nand\nc\ngo to infinity. For finite arrays, the optimum number of rows is given by\nr = -0.5 + sqrt\n, where\nn\nis the total number of buildings to be boosted.\nThe formula above does not generally return integer results. If the\nr\nthus found is non-integer, iterate around it, i.e., calculate the number of beacons needed with\nfloor(r)\n(the next lower integer) and\nceiling(r)\n(the next higher integer) rows and compare the results. For each such integer\nr\n, calculate\nc\nas\nfloor(n ÷ r)\n, then calculate the number of beacons as\nB(r,c)\n+\nmod(n,r)\n+ 1, where\nB(r,c)\nis given above and\nmod(n,r)\nis\nn\nmodulo\nr\n, i.e., the remainder of (\nn\n÷\nr\n), equal to\nn\n- (\nr\n×\nc\n).\nThere will in either case be\nmod(n,r)\nbuildings \"left over\"; these should be appended one per row to the ends of a contiguous block of neighboring rows for the total beacon count calculation above to be valid. Other configurations for the leftovers (e.g. all appended to the end of a single row, one each at the end of every second row, etc.) require a higher number of beacons to cover.\nOptimal arrays\nFor 3×3 structures, arrays satisfying\nc = 3r\nare optimal, in the sense that they minimize the number of beacons required to cover the total number of structures (\nrc\n), therefore allowing the most use out of an individual beacon. Since structures may only be built in integer amounts, there are, below a reasonable cutoff on total array size, only a finite number of integer structure counts\nrc\nwith which an optimal array such that\nc = 3r\nand\nc\nand\nr\nare integer may be built. The first few counts, along with associated array sizes and beacons-to-structures ratios, are summarized in the table below.\nStructures\nRows\nColumns\nBeacons\nBeacons per structure\nDimensions (tiles)*\n3\n1\n3\n12\n4.00\n18×11\n12\n2\n6\n27\n2.25\n27×19\n27\n3\n9\n48\n1.78\n36×27\n48\n4\n12\n75\n1.56\n45×35\n75\n5\n15\n108\n1.44\n54×43\n108\n6\n18\n147\n1.36\n63×51\n147\n7\n21\n192\n1.31\n72×59\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n3r^2\nr\n3r\n(r + 1) (3r + 3)\n1 + 2/r + 1/r^2\n(9r + 9) × (8r + 3)\nNotes to table:\nArray dimension in tiles (last table column) assumes 2 tiles' space (e.g. inserter + chest) is left either above or below each row of structures, while no extra space is left anywhere else.\nThe 5-row array (75 structures) is the largest that can be covered by a logistic network generated from roboports located outside its footprint. For larger arrays, at least a minimal number of roboports would need to be strategically placed in the interior to provide coverage, thereby worsening the beacons-to-structures proportion somewhat.\n2.0.7\n:\nIncreased beacon stack size from 10 to 20.\nDiminishing return of beacons effect.
