Storage tank Edit Recipe 3 + 20 + 5 → 1 Total raw 3 + 20 + 5 Map color Fluid storage volume 25000 Health 500 650 800 950 1250 Stack size 50 Rocket capacity 50 Dimensions 3×3 Mining time 0.5 Prototype type storage-tank Internal name storage-tank Required technologies Produced by Consumed by The storage tank is a building that can store up to 25,000 units of a fluid . It is a passive storage — it has no input and no output, essentially acting as volume increase of the pipe segment it is connected to. Contents 1 Usage 2 Usage as \"Energy-tank\" 2.1 Calculations 3 Gallery 4 History 5 See also Usage The storage tank is often used to store raw materials and excess products from oil processing , allowing a refinery to run without interruptions. It can be used as short term buffer to keep up throughput for high volume recipes such as acid neutralisation and steam condensation to avoid the machines getting full or empty. It can also be connected to the circuit network , sending the fluid contents as a signal to the network. Storage tanks are part of the fluid segment they are connected to, so they are always filled to the same percentage of capacity as the pipes that lead to it. As there is no real flow in the pipes, a storage tank is always filled evenly with the segment it is connected to, regardless of how far away an inflow is. If there are multiple storage tanks connected to the same pipe segment, they all have exactly the same fill state. The fluid inside the storage tank can be destroyed by flushing the storage tank or the whole fluid system in the GUI, or by mining and rebuilding the storage tank. The storage tank can be emptied without destroying the contained fluid by draining it with a pump . Mining a storage tank will send its contents to the next nearest storage tanks, if the fluids match. Usage as \"Energy-tank\" See also: Steam tanks as power storage Storage tanks can also be used as a replacement for accumulators . If steam consumption by steam engines or turbines changes a lot over a daily cycle (for example due to solar panels or laser turrets ), storage tanks can be filled with steam during low power usage and then emptied during heavy load. A storage tank filled with heat exchanger 500°C steam stores around 2.4GJ; a storage tank filled with boiler 165°C steam stores 750MJ. Calculations 1 Storage tank can store 25,000 units of 500ºC steam. 1 Steam turbine can output 5,820kW = 5,820kJ/s using 60 units of 500ºC steam/s. 1 Storage tank can keep 1 steam turbine working at full capacity for 25,000 ∕ 60 ≈ 416.6667s A Storage tank can store up to 25,000 ∕ 60 × 5,820 = 2,425,000kJ using 500ºC steam. 1 Storage tank can store 25,000 units of 165ºC steam. 1 Steam engine can output 900kW = 900kJ/s using 30 units of 165ºC steam/s. 1 Storage tank can keep 1 steam engine working for 25,000 ∕ 30 ≈ 833.3333s A Storage tank can store up to 25,000 ∕ 30 × 900 = 750,000kJ using 165ºC steam.

It is powered by burning fuel , compared to the more advanced inserters which are powered by electricity . It will add fuel to its own supply if it picks any up, which makes it useful for filling boilers with coal . This has the advantage that it will continue working even if the power fails, as opposed to electrically-powered inserters which will be unable to function. It consumes no fuel while idle, though it consumes vastly more energy than most other inserters when active. Even though it doesn't use electricity, a burner inserter can be connected to and controlled by the logistic and the circuit network . Fuel consumption A burner inserter consumes no power while idle and does not continuously consume the maximum amount of power when working. Burner Inserters spawn with an internal energy buffer of 500 kJ, represented as 25% the value of a piece of wood fuel (which is 2MJ). Aside from not having drain, all its other power characteristics are identical to the rest of the inserters. It simply pulls its joules from its fuel rather than your power grid. For more detailed information on inserter power characteristics you can reference the main page here . Burners also have a behavior known as \"leeching\" where they will pull fuel from their input and commandeer it for their own use. This leeching behavior is not exactly quantified, but it is triggered whenever the internal fuel inventory reaches zero, and performing the action also consumes fuel since motion is never free.

Moving at the speed of the fast inserter , it transfers multiple items per cycle to give it a material flow advantage at the cost of additional power consumption. When transferring between chests or cargo wagons it picks up and drops off the entire stack of items instantly. When picking up from or dropping off items onto a transport belt a bulk inserter needs to grab or drop each item individually, increasing the time between arm swings and lowering its potential throughput. In these cases, however, the bulk inserter still has higher throughput than a fast inserter because it swings back and forth less often. The throughput from chest to chest for a fully upgraded bulk inserter is 27.69 items per second, but only 13.85 items/s from chest to express belt . A bulk inserter cannot carry more items than the item's stack size. Stack size The stack size is increased by the inserter capacity bonus (research) technology.

This article is about the new inserter introduced in Space Age . For the base game inserter with large transfer abilities, see bulk inserter . The stack inserter is an electric inserter that can move multiple items at the same time and build stacks on belts . It has a larger maximum hand size than the bulk inserter while turning at the same rate, giving it a 33% higher throughput. Unlike other inserters, it will not insert into its target until it has collected a full hand size of items. While usually beneficial, this can be a problem if more materials from the source are not forthcoming. In particular, holding onto spoilable items can lead to reduced freshness or even completely spoiling into a less useful item. This particular feature of the stack inserter means that it is not a complete upgrade to the bulk inserter ; there will be cases where the latter is more appropriate. To avoid getting stuck, if the item it is holding while waiting for more items spoils into a different item, then it will turn immediately to discard its hand. Similarly, if the inserter is given a filter, and that filter changes to no longer include the item in its hand, the stack inserter will immediately turn and discard its hand. This latter feature can make it easy to force the inserter to become unstuck . Contents 1 Belt stacking 2 Stack size 3 Tips 4 Trivia 5 History 6 See also Belt stacking When a stack inserter inserts items onto a belt, it will stack them to the maximum belt stack size currently researched. The Stack inserter research increases the maximum belt stack to 2, with two further researches increasing it to 4. The stack inserter will attempt to always build stacks of the maximum size currently researched. This has particular interactions with the inserter's hand size. When inserting onto a belt (and only when doing so), the hand size is always rounded down to the next multiple of the current maximum belt stack size. This means that it will almost always build full stacks even if this moves fewer items than the hand size says it should. There are several cases where the stack inserter will not build full stacks on belts. First, if the hand size is less than the current maximum belt stack size (so rounding down would result in a hand size of 0), then the stack inserter will respect the exact hand size and build partial stacks. Second, as previously indicated, if the stack inserter is holding a spoilable item, and that item spoils, then the stack inserter will insert that item into its destination immediately, building whatever stacks it can when inserting onto a belt. This also applies to changing the filter of the stack inserter. There is a very rare third case: if the research for maximum belt stacks changes while the inserter is moving to insert onto a belt, then it will build whatever stacks it can onto that belt using the new belt stack limit. When inserting into containers or machines, the hand size will be exactly respected. Stack size The stack size for stack inserters is increased by the Inserter capacity bonus (research) technology (though you will likely have already researched most if not all of these upgrades before researching stack inserters). The stack size can be overridden to set how many items it picks up at one time, with the maximum being the highest research level currently unlocked. Inserter capacity bonus Stack size bonus Total stack size none 0 6 1 +1 7 2 +1 8 3 +1 9 4 +1 10 5 +2 12 6 +2 14 7 +2 16 Tips The stack inserter usually does not turn until it has its full hand size. While this is often desireable, there are circumstances where this behavior can pose a problem. There are ways to force a stack inserter to discard its current hand contents. The primary tool for doing this is to control the stack inserter's filtered item list. If the filters change such that the item in the inserter's hand is no longer on the list of valid filtered items, then the inserter will immediately turn to drop its hand regardless of how much is there. When inserting from a container into something else (a belt, machine, etc), one can employ the circuit network . If you wire the stack inserter to that container, and set the stack inserter to filter items based on the circuit network, then everything automatically works. If the stack inserter's hand is not full, that can only be because the container ran out of items of that type. Which means that the container will no longer broadcast a positive signal of that item's type. And that means the stack inserter's filters will not be filtered on the item in the stack inserter's hand. And therefore, it will immediately turn to drop the items. This can also work on various crafting machines, as they can be set to broadcast their contents. Their contents do include their input slots, but this is safe as output inserters cannot output items in the input slots of a machine. However, because broadcasting contents does include the items in those input slots as filters, if the recipe requires more than 5 total inputs and outputs, this mechanism may not work. Inserter filters can only filter on 5 items at once, so if there are more than 5 items to be filtered, then the system will pick 5 of them arbitrarily. And if there are 5 inputs, the filtered set may never include any of the outputs. Note that for machines dealing with spoilable items , the 5 item limit also includes any possible spoil products. This mechanism can be adapted to handle recipes with larger numbers of inputs by using combinator machinery to filter out any signals that are not the desired outputs. Stack inserters that insert from a belt can also do this. The belt they are inserting from can be wired to the stack inserter and told to read that belt tile's contents. However, this will prevent the inserter from waiting for more items, so it can lead to more insertions than is strictly needed. Trivia When first mentioned in FFF #393 , the stack inserter was instead called the \"bulk inserter\". However, in response to feedback from the audience, the developers announced in the following FFF that its name would be swapped with that of what was previously known as a \"stack inserter\" , as this naming was deemed more appropriate. History 2.0.18 : Bulk inserter no longer can be upgraded to a stack inserter. 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

Contents 1 Overview 2 Throughput 3 Loading/unloading fluid wagons 4 Use as a valve 5 Moving fluids over long distances 6 Animations and visuals 7 History 8 See also Overview A Pump is a multipurpose fluid handling device which can be used to move fluids over long distances, perform flow control, prevent back-flow and load/unload trains. The pump can be seen as the inserter for fluids. When connected to pipes on both ends of the pump and powered, the pump will transfer fluid from the source side to the output side if it will fit. This will occur even if the input side has significantly lower fluid levels. Furthermore, unlike normal pipes, pumps can connect to pipes only on the front and back of the pump instead of connecting to pipes from all sides. This can be useful for having tightly packed lines of pipes being parallel to each other, without the risk of fluids mixing, acting as a \"diode\" pipe. Parallel pumps preventing side connections. Throughput Pumps can move up to 20 units of fluid per tick, or 1200 per second. Whether this throughput is actually achieved depends on the fluid level of the fluid segments upstream and downstream of the pump. If the level of the source segment is below 20%, 1200 units can no longer be achieved. The same applies if the level of the output segment is above 80%. Comprehensive information on the general behavior of fluids can be found on the page fluid system . Loading/unloading fluid wagons Pumps can load and unload fluid wagons at train stops . When a pump is placed with one end facing a rail track and the other end connected to a pipe, it will visually change. When a fluid wagon is stopped adjacent, the pump head will connect to the top of the nearest tank and begin transferring fluids. It will not connect if a circuit condition is preventing it, or it is unpowered. Pump transferring fluids to a fluid wagon. Use as a valve The pump works as a controllable valve: When powered, the pump will let fluids through, but only in its set direction. If unpowered, the pump doesn't let anything through. If the pump is powered but has a circuit condition, it will only let fluids through when the condition is met. This can be used to control some parts of a player's factory. For example, with a single wire from a lubricant tank to a pump pumping heavy oil , you can disable cracking heavy oil → light oil when lubricant is needed. Moving fluids over long distances When a fluid is created, it can travel up to 320 tiles from it's existing location until it needs a pump. Pumps reset this value, allowing fluids to travel for another 320 tiles until another one is needed. If a pipe has been overextended, a warning will show on the map.

Unlike transport belts , rail tracks can also be curved and placed diagonally. Train stops , rail signals and rail chain signals can be placed on rails to better guide automated trains. Gates can also be placed on rails, making them rail gates. In Space Age , rails can be connected to rail ramps and rail supports to build elevated rails. Elevated rails allow trains to freely pass over obstacles. The minimum rail turning radius is 13, meaning the smallest possible 180° turn has 26 tiles between the centers of opposite rails. However, due to rails being two tiles wide, the actual footprint is 28 tiles wide. The rail planner can be used to automatically place rails. See the page for more info.

Further recommendations for this page's clean-up can be made at Talk:Rail support . Space Age expansion exclusive feature. A Rail support is placed under an elevated rail , acting as its foundation. When planning out elevated rails, supports will be automatically added between some units of rails. Supports act as obstacles, and can be removed at any time if one is added. While players are required to own Space Age to access this feature, elevated rails are a separate mod, and can be activated independent of most Space Age content. Placement Each rail support can hold up to five straight rail segments in either direction. It can also accommodate two curved rail segments, or a mix of one curved segment and three straight segments. Elevated rails are naturally able to be placed over most obstacles, such as buildings, cliffs , and water. However some buildings, like big electric poles are too tall to have elevated rails placed above them. Rail supports can be placed on top of water on Nauvis , oil oceans on Fulgora , marshes on Gleba and ammoniacal oceans on Aquilo without the need for landfill or foundation . After researching rail support foundations , they can also be placed on Fulgora's deep oil oceans. Elevated rails vs landfill For an elevated rail, to place 5 rails over water requires 1 elevated rail support, or a total raw of 66 iron ore and 40 stone (not including rail ramp or rails ), and for landfill , to place 5 rails over water requires 20 landfill, or a total raw of 1000 stone (not inculding rails ). Therefore it's significantly more efficient to use elevated rails rather than using landfill. History 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

Like locomotives , the color of the stops can be customized. Furthermore, the stop can be named, with rich text making it possible to further customize the name, such as by adding item icons. Contents 1 Mechanics 2 Circuit Network 3 Indicators 4 Gallery 5 History 6 See also Mechanics Train stops are used to denote a place for a train to stop. Every placed train stop will appear as a possible stop in the scheduling area of a train 's GUI. This can be used to create loading and unloading stations for trains. When there are multiple train stops with the same name, trains will always travel to the closest stop. \"Closest\" in this case does not mean rail distance, instead the pathfinding distance is used. This distance is influenced by trains on the track, in addition to rail distance, so empty train stops are preferred over occupied ones if the empty stop is not too far away. Opening the GUI of a stop will show the information of every train connected to that stop, including its name, current activity and location on the map. Additionally, it is possible to set a train limit for train stops via their GUI or with the circuit network. Only the set amount of trains may reserve the train stop as their destination when trying to path to it. If the train limit is lowered below the amount of trains that currently have the stop reserved as their destination, those trains will continue to go to the stop. Trains will attempt to avoid routes that pass through stops that are not designated as the next destination. This is represented by a penalty to the pathfinding distance, which usually forces a train to pick a \"shorter\" path. Circuit Network Train stops can be enabled or disabled using the circuit network . When a train stop is disabled, trains will not go to that station. If a train is scheduled to go to a stop that is disabled, it will select a stop with the same name which is enabled. If no such stops exist, the train will enter the \"destination full\" state and wait until a stop becomes enabled again. If a train is en-route or already parked at a stop when it becomes disabled, the train will continue to the stop and complete its wait conditions. When a train attempts to go to an enabled stop, it first checks to see if the stop has a \"train limit\" set. This limit specifies the maximum number of trains allowed to go to this station. If the number of trains headed to that stop (including one sitting at the stop) is greater than or equal to the stop's current train limit, then the train will not go to that stop. It will check other enabled stops with that name. If all stops with that name are full, the train will enter the \"destination full\" state. Once a stop with that name opens up to allow more trains, the train will proceed. Like disabling, if a train limit changes while a train is en-route to a stop, the train will continue to the stop and complete its wait conditions. A stop with a train limit of 0 behaves identically to a stop which has been disabled. When there are multiple valid stops with the same name, the train will next check each stop's \"priority\". Stop priority can be set manually or with the circuit network, and can be set between 0 and 255, defaulting to 50. The lowest priority is 0, and the highest priority is 255. Trains will prefer stops with a higher priority. If all valid stops have the same priority value, the train will select the closest stop. Priority values are only considered when a train is dispatched; if a train is en-route and priority values of its stop change so that it is no longer going to the highest priority stop, the train will not re-path to the new highest priority stop and will continue on its original schedule. While a train is en-route, it may repath to a different train stop of the same name, provided the new train stop has not reached its capacity. When this happens, the train ceases to count toward the train limit of the original stop. Train stops can be used to pass circuit signals to trains, read train contents, uniquely identify trains with an ID number, or count the amount of trains going to the train stop. When reading the content of a stopped train, fluid amounts are rounded down to the nearest integer, except when the fluid amount is < 1, then it is is rounded to 1. Indicators There are indicator lights on the top of the train stop. These show: Solid light – The train stop is unoccupied/available. Alternate blinking – A train is approaching or passing the train stop. Simultaneous blinking – A train is stopped/occupying the train stop. No lights – The train stop is invalid. Blinking red – The train stop is disabled via circuit network. Gallery Three railways with different color train stops. Four trains listed in a train stop's GUI.

Blocks span all connected rails regardless if a train can actually travel between them. Rail signals can also be used in with conjunction rail chain signals , which also separate rails into blocks. In addition to the explanation on this page, there is also the rail signal tutorial . Signals dividing rails into blocks. Each block is highlighted with a different color. Contents 1 Direction 2 States 3 Circuit network 4 History 5 See also Direction Which block a signal monitors depends on which side of a rail it is placed. When a signal is on the right-hand side of the track, it monitors and protects the rail block behind it, up to the next signal or the end of the track. When placing rail signals, the rail signal blocks will be visible, and the opposite signal position will be highlighted in white. A train in automatic mode will not drive on a track if it would pass a signal on the left side unless there is also a signal on the right side at that signal. States Rail signals have four states: Green - The monitored block is empty. Yellow - A train is not able to stop before the monitored block and will pass the signal. The debug option show-train-braking-distance can be used to see the distance locomotives need to stop. A yellow signal means that a train is approaching and already has the approval to enter the following block. The block is reserved for a train and all other entrance signals of that block turn red. Red - The monitored block is not empty or another signal monitoring it is yellow. Blinking - The signal is not on a rail, or the monitored block is also the block before the signal. When a signal is red, locomotives will stop before it. A rail chain signal can be used to make locomotives stop earlier, as they will always mimic the signal of what is in front of them. Circuit network The interface for configuring a circuit network connection for a rail signal. A circuit network condition can be configured that when true will make the rail signal red. A rail signal can also output three different signals depending on if it is in its green, yellow or red state. If a rail signal is red because of a circuit network condition the rail signal won't output a circuit network signal. History 0.13.0 : The rail signal is now connectable to the circuit network.

With rail chain signals, it is possible to use multiple trains on a single track, or multiple rails that intertwine. Rail chain signals can be used to ensure that trains only enter a crossing if they can also leave it, which ensures that they do not block other traffic by waiting on the crossing. In addition to the explanation on this page, there is also the rail signal tutorial . Contents 1 Basic 2 Definition 3 Advanced 4 Usage examples 5 History 6 See also Basic The best prerequisite to understand chain signals is to understand signal blocks . Rail chain signals are placed like regular signals at the right side of the railway track. If automated trains are required to drive in both directions on the same track segment, signals need to be added on both sides of the track, opposite each other. Definition Both normal signals and chain signals prevent a train from entering the next block if it is obstructed.  However, a chain signal also looks ahead to the next signal, and turns red if the next signal is red.  In effect, this prevents a train from entering a block if it won't be able to leave. When more than one exits exist, the one where the train is pathing to is considered. Advanced If the chain signal has only one exit, it doesn't allow the train to enter its block, if the train would have to stop in said block. Since trains react to chain signals based on their own path, chain signals before a crossing will not stop trains if the other track's exit is blocked. If there are several chain signals before a regular one, a train waits before the first chain signal if the block after the regular signal is occupied. If a chain signal switches to green , all exits are free. If it switches to yellow , the block is reserved for a train and all other entrance signals of that block turn red . If it switches to red , all exits are occupied. If it switches to blue , some but not all exits are free. In this case trains may or may not stop, depending on their path. If it is blinking , it is not on a rail, or unable to divide it into separate blocks. Usage examples Regular signal compared to a chain signal With a regular signal, the block after it is empty, so the train can go there. Chain signal with one exit doesn't allow the train to enter the block, since it can't leave immediately. Simple example with practical usage The chain signal prevents the train from blocking the crossing route while waiting. Double crossing Double crossings are a common cause of train jams, as trains can stop in the middle of the crossing and block everything. It can even cause total deadlock, which require manual intervention to fix the problem. With chain signals, the rails that don't cross are still separated, but trains won't stop in the middle of the crossing. Deadlock prevention Another common cause of blockages are bidirectional single track lines with occasional bypasses. Here a train can't enter the line because another train is in it, but that train in turn can't leave the line. With chain signals, this problem can be totally avoided by preventing the train from going to the shared section unless it can exit it.

Trains are useful for moving large amounts of items over large distances. With the Space Age expansion, locomotives can also utilize elevated rails , which are rails built off of a rail ramp , allowing trains to freely drive over obstacles on the ground. Locomotives are also good vehicles for the player to reach fixed destinations, as they are considerably faster than the car or tank .  Naturally, they do not have the same freedom of movement, as they are confined to the track. They can be set up to travel automatically between train stops , or be controlled manually, even if the player is in a cargo wagon attached to the train instead of the locomotive itself. Automatic trains can also use rail signals and rail chain signals to designate different or changing paths on a railway, as well as manage multiple trains on multiple or intertwining tracks. Locomotives are burner devices and require fuel to run; the more powerful the fuel used, the faster the locomotive's acceleration and top speed will be. Solid fuel , rocket fuel and nuclear fuel will give +20%, +80% and +150% acceleration respectively, and provide +5%, +15% and +15% for top speed respectively. Multiple locomotives can be used on a single train to increase its speed. If a locomotive has no fuel, it can still be moved manually, albeit very slowly. While locomotives can be assembled by hand, the engine unit for it requires automated construction to build, so it cannot be built from raw materials by hand. The color of the locomotive can be customized. Contents 1 Connecting/Disconnecting a locomotive 2 Defense 3 Maximum speed 4 Fuel duration (in seconds) 5 Driving controls 6 Achievements 7 Gallery 8 History 9 See also Connecting/Disconnecting a locomotive Locomotive GUI To connect locomotives, cargo wagons, or fluid wagons to each other, either place the cars next to each other on the track (there will be an outlined green connection), or connect an already existing disconnected car by driving the locomotive near the car and press G by default. To disconnect the last car in a train, press V by default. Defense Locomotives in transit can usually crash through everything in its way (including biters, other vehicles , and the player). However, if the locomotive is moving too slowly, or the target is too tough, it will stop the train instead. Once stopped, the train will continually do damage if trying to accelerate. If the locomotive hits an enemy , the enemies will fight back and try to destroy the train and the rails. Construction robots are a good way to automatically repair damage at train stations. Train killing three big biters. Maximum speed The maximum speed that a locomotive can get to depends on the train that it is pulling. The speed of an accelerating, fully fueled, train is calculated every tick by the game with the following formula: train_speed = max(0, abs(train_speed) - train_friction_force ÷ train_weight)\ntrain_speed = train_speed + (10 × number_of_locomotives_in_moving_direction × fuel_acceleration_bonus ÷ train_weight)\ntrain_speed = train_speed × (1 - air_resistance_of_front_rolling_stock ÷ (train_weight ÷ 1000)) where train_friction_force is the total friction of each wagon and locomotive (0.5 for any type of wagon including locomotives) and train_weight is the total weight of each wagon and locomotive (see their individual pages for the weight values). The friction and air resistance of wagons and locomotives can be found in their prototypes. The calculated train_speed is capped to max_speed = 1.2 * fuel_top_speed_multiplier .

A wagon is used to transport items and can be filled and emptied like a chest, but with many more inserters at the same time. Up to 12 inserters per wagon are possible (from both sides).\nThe inserter item stack size is important to fill the wagon fast! In manual-mode cargo wagons can only be filled or emptied when they are not moving. In automated-mode it is the same, but additionally they can only filled/empty, when stopped on a train-stop (not at a signal). A spot where inserters are positioned to transfer cargo for wagons is called a train station . Wagons have a stack limitation option the same way chests do, which can be used to limit the number of transported items. \nEach stack in the cargo wagon can be filtered. This works in the same way as the filtering slots in other vehicles; the default key to define or remove the filter is the Middle mouse button . Players can enter a cargo wagon and control any connected locomotives. Contents 1 Processing of items before transport 2 Use as a big chest 3 History 4 See also Processing of items before transport A cargo wagon can be filled with 2000 items of ores ( copper , iron , ...) or 4000 items of processed plates ( Copper plates , iron plates , ...). This can make preprocessing of ores into plates near the mines a useful strategy, because the transport of plates is more efficient. Stack size is not the only factor to consider when comparing train transport of preprocessed items to raw items. Some raw items craft into a smaller amount of processed items. One example are iron plates, 5 iron plates can be crafted into 1 steel plate which means that when transported by train, the throughput increases by 5 times. Use as a big chest It is possible to use the cargo wagon as a \"big chest\": Place rails, put an unmoving wagon on it and inserters around. The advantages of this construction are: Cargo can be transferred with many more inserters than with a chest, bypassing the limitations of the inserter stack size bonus . Items are transported instantly over the length of the wagon. Correctly configured, this is faster than a transport belt. The inventory slots can be filtered and the inventory size can be limited. Disadvantages include: It cannot be connected to the circuit network . Its contents can be read from a station if it is part of a train stopped at that station, but different wagons in the same train cannot be distinguished. It cannot be accessed by logistic robots . It has a smaller capacity than a steel chest (40 slots vs 48), which is not affected by quality . History 0.15.0 : Cargo wagons can have settings copied from any distance like Locomotives.

It fires artillery shells , relatively slow-moving projectiles that explore chunks of terrain they travel across. The wagon gun has both automatic and manual (even longer-ranged) firing modes. Projectiles have sufficient damage to destroy spawners and any type of worm with a single hit, and have a modest area of effect. Infinitely-stacking research upgrades are available for range and firing speed, but not damage. The artillery turret is essentially the same weapon, but deployed as a static structure like other turrets . Contents 1 Mechanics 2 Limitations 3 Train properties 4 Logistics 5 Achievements 6 Trivia 7 History 8 See also Mechanics Artillery wagons, like Artillery turrets, have a massive range, outranging non-Artillery fixed fortifications by a factor of 10 or more. In automatic mode, when the train is stopped, the artillery wagon will automatically scan for enemy structures (spawners and worms) and shoot at them. Automatic mode cannot target mobile units (biters and spitters); shells do, however, damage mobile units in the vicinity of impact normally. In manual mode, an Artillery targeting remote is used to point-and-click anywhere in the world, map, or zoomed-in map; each click corresponds to one shell delivered to that location, so long as any working artillery turrets and / or wagons are in range. Targeting remotes show the number of fire-ready (loaded and, for wagons, stationary) artillery pieces in range of cursor position when held. Manual fire can be ordered on unexplored areas; shells will explore all chunks they travel across (but no surrounding chunks). Range in automatic mode is 224 tiles (7 chunks); in manual mode, 560 tiles (17.5 chunks). Infinite research is available to increase range, at +30% of base range per level, applied to both automatic and manual range. Limitations Aside from the considerable expense of research and assembly for both wagons and shells, there are certain considerations that make these wagons unwise as a full replacement for traditional base defenses, despite their phenomenal range and the advantage of mobility. Artillery shelling will antagonize enemy mobile units in the vicinity of the impact into rushing the wagon's location at time of firing, regardless of their normal \"aggro radius\". Artillery wagons are relatively slow-firing, although infinite research is available to improve firing speed, at +100% per level, affecting both wagons and stationary turrets and applying to both automatic and manual mode. They also cannot target mobile units in automatic mode. Importantly, artillery has a minimum range as well, which is 32 tiles. Together, these limitations mean that an artillery wagon needs to be defended, or else moved around rapidly, in the latter case decreasing its value as base defense. For defense, any conventional approach such as walls, gun, laser, and / or flamethrower turrets, or the personal intervention of the player will do. However, players should keep in mind that extensive shelling of large biter-infested areas will produce massive attack waves centered on the position of the artillery piece at time of firing, and should plan close-range defenses accordingly. Logistic considerations are also important, as artillery shells have a stack size of 1, meaning any-size container can only hold a modest supply and an inserter will only ever move a single shell at a time. Players may wish to consider assembling near artillery wagon stops if practical. The wagon itself can hold a supply of 100 shells (while artillery turrets only hold 15), providing a portable magazine of some size that can be towed around with the weapon without external storage. Train properties The artillery wagon can fire while stopped at a train stop, but not when stopped at a red signal or when moving. A train in automatic mode that is \"No-Path\"ing will not fire. When a train with an artillery wagon is stopped at a train stop, aiming and shooting counts as activity for the purposes of \"X seconds of inactivity\" departure conditions in the train's schedule. This includes the time that the wagon spends scanning the area around it to find enemies, which is done at 1 chunk per tick. Only when it has scanned all chunks and did not find an enemy it will count as inactive. When part of a manual-mode (player-driven) train, artillery wagons will fire whenever the train is stopped, regardless of where it was stopped. Artillery wagons weigh as much as 4 regular wagons (or 2 locomotives ) for the purposes of train acceleration calculations. Fortunately, nuclear fuel provides a massive 250% boost to acceleration (compared to 180% for rocket fuel, the next best type), making it an attractive fuel for artillery trains. Logistics In addition to firing them, artillery wagons can be used to transport shells from place to place. Inserters will both load and unload artillery wagons in the same manner as they would any other wagon, with the obvious difference that artillery wagons can only take artillery shells as cargo. However, each artillery wagon can hold 100 shells, while a regular cargo wagon only holds 40. Thus, artillery wagons are the most space-efficient method of transporting artillery shells by rail. They are not, however, the most mass-efficient one, as an artillery wagon weighs 4 times as much as a regular wagon, but holds only 2.5 times as many shells. Thus, if train length is not a concern but acceleration and / or fuel efficiency is, regular wagons are superior for transporting shells. Achievements Art of siege Destroy an enemy structure using artillery . Keeping your hands clean Destroy your first enemy structure using artillery . Trivia Large rail-transported cannon were built in the late 19th and early 20th century, up until and including World War II. The larger models were heavy and very slow firing and took many hours to set up, but had a greater range and power per shot than any other weapon in existence at the time (considerably greater than battleship-size naval guns, for example). The advent of rocketry, as well as large bomber planes capable of deploying multi-ton bombs, eventually made these guns obsolete. Perhaps the best-known example is the Schwerer Gustav (Heavy Gustav), the largest gun ever fired. History 2.0.7 : Trains with artillery wagons now need to wait for all cannons to be in fully their parked position before departing. When driving manually, keep holding accelerate to command the artillery to stop firing and assume their parked position.

The car is the earliest alternate form of transportation available to the player , and is one of three non-rail vehicles in Factorio; the others being the tank and the spidertron . Although it requires fuel, driving a car is much faster than running, letting the player scout out areas or outmaneuver enemies . Cars have a vehicle machine gun that has a 50% higher rate of fire and can fire two tiles farther than the submachine gun , 80 slots of storage and 450 health, allowing the player to use hit-and-run tactics against small groups of enemies. Cars can collide with objects. Both the car and the object collided with may take damage. The damage is dependent on the speed of the car and the health of the target; small biters and trees can be safely rammed but colliding with big biters can easily destroy the vehicle and its contents. If the car is destroyed, its inventory is destroyed with it, though the player gets ejected and not killed. In multiplayer, it is possible for a player to enter a car alongside another player. The passenger can take control of the weapons of the car using a switch in the GUI of the car, but cannot steer the car. Cars will take on the color of the player who drove it last. Cars are moved by transport belts and inserters can interact with them. Because of that, cars may be used as large chests or as another mean of transportation besides belts, trains and robots . Controls Main article: Controls Accelerating opposite of the velocity of the car will cause it to brake. Held acceleration controls won't have any effect after a brake. The faster the car is going, the longer distance it will take to brake. The more powerful the fuel used to power the car, the faster the car's acceleration: Solid fuel adds 20% acceleration, rocket fuel adds 80% while nuclear fuel adds 150%. Stone brick will reduce rolling resistance on cars, with concrete and refined concrete equally reducing resistance even further. When using a controller, such as on the Nintendo Switch , the behaviour of the left joystick in vehicles can be switched between two modes: Relative vehicle driving mode (default): Moving the stick in a direction will make vehicles automatically turn and accelerate to that side of the screen. Absolute vehicle driving mode: Moving the stick up/down will make vehicles accelerate/brake. Moving the stick left/right will make vehicles turn in that direction. Cars cannot be remote controlled and have no equipment grid, unlike the tank and spidertron .

The tank is a heavy armored fighting vehicle . It is a mid-game vehicle with three weapons; an integrated submachine gun , a short range flamethrower and a powerful cannon that uses cannon shells . It, along with the car and spidertron , are the three non-rail vehicles in Factorio. In multiplayer , it is possible for a player to enter a tank alongside another player. The passenger can take control of the weapons of the tank using a switch in the GUI of the tank, but cannot steer the tank. Since engine units can only be built in assembling machines , tanks (like cars) cannot be built from scratch by hand from their raw materials. If the tank is destroyed, its inventory is destroyed with it, though the player gets ejected and not killed. Tanks will change color based on the color of the player who drove it last. Tanks can be driven remotely. Coupled with the tank's equipment grid, the player can remotely manipulate distant outposts without being there as well as to remotely expand the base by attacking enemy nests . However, unlike the spidertron, the tank lacks any map-revealing capabilities, and so is effectively confined to areas where the player has sufficient radar coverage. The tank and its weapons continue to operate normally if driven outside of visual range, but if the player \"exits\" the vehicle while in the fog of war then the tank will be stranded until visual contact can be re-established. Contents 1 Achievements 2 Combat 3 Movement 4 Speeds 4.1 Tank top speed (km/h) 4.2 Speed in reverse 5 Capsules and Bots integration 6 Exclusive Weapons 6.1 Flamethrower 6.2 Cannon 7 History 8 Development data 9 See also Achievements Steamrolled Destroy 10 spawners by impact. Run Forrest, run Destroy 100 trees by impact. Combat The tank is a strong fighting vehicle due to its large health pool and the very high damage of its main weapon, the cannon. Construction robots can also repair the tank with repair packs , and the tank can even bring its own robots to do so using the personal roboport equipment. The tank's weaponry can be augmented by equipment modules like the personal laser defense . If the player is inside of the tank, the player can deploy thrown items such as grenades , poison capsules , and follower robots from within the tank. The tank particularly shines in battle against worms , as their high damage projectiles are much less of a problem for an entity with a high health pool. Defensive equipment or capsules/drones can be used to deal with mobile enemies. The tank has a lower base speed than the car and is less maneuverable than a player outside of a vehicle. As a result, it may not perform as well in combat against melee enemies or enemies with shorter range than the player, as it has more difficulty dodging enemies and avoiding cliffs . This may result in the tank being destroyed quickly, leaving the player in a tight spot. Movement The tank is very robust, and unlike the car can move through and destroy trees without taking damage. Even when not moving, simply driving into an entity is enough to damage it. This can also be employed as a weapon against enemies , although certain enemies and structures (nests in particular) will deal high damage to the tank in the process, requiring repair after skirmishes. The tank's default speed is slower than the car, and movement speed bonuses from terrain (e.g. concrete ) are substantially reduced. Unlike the car, the tank can be rotated in place without moving forwards or backwards. The speed and, in particular, responsiveness of the tank can be improved somewhat by burning better fuel . The tank, like all other vehicles, gains top speed and acceleration bonuses when running on solid fuel, rocket fuel and nuclear fuel, as opposed to wood or coal. The bonuses are +5% / +15% / +15% top speed and +20% / +80% / +150% acceleration for solid fuel, rocket fuel and nuclear fuel, respectively; wood and coal both yield the base level of top speed and acceleration. Exoskeletons can also be installed into the tank's equipment grid to increase its top speed as though the tank was the player. Equipping 3 exoskeletons allows the tank to outrun a car on any natural terrain, and with 5 exoskeletons the tank surpasses the car's maximum possible speed. Increasing the tank's speed with exoskeletons does not affect the tank's acceleration or deceleration, so it will take some time for the tank to accelerate to its top speed, as well as to stop from that speed. Given how destructive the tank can be to buildings, using many exoskeletons in a tank can make it dangerous to one's own base.

Speed in reverse The top speed of the tank in reverse is ~70.6% of the forward top speed. Capsules and Bots integration The player directly driving the tank cannot fire any weapons equipped on the player. However, the player still has access to their inventory. The player can use inventory items, such as capsules and combat robots . The player's equipment modules are also available, so the player's construction robots run by a personal roboport can still be deployed from within the tank, which will use repair packs from the player to repair the tank. If the tank and the player both have personal laser defenses , both can be active at the same time. Upon researching logistic system , the tank can utilize the logistic network to make requests like a player. Exclusive Weapons Flamethrower A powerful short-ranged weapon that consumes flamethrower ammo . Unlike the hand-held flamethrower or the flamethrower turret , the tank version does not set entities on fire. Cannon The tank's cannon is one of the few weapons that damages anything in a line between the tank and the target. All cannon shells have the ability to pierce targets, which means that if the shell deals enough damage to kill what it hits, the shell can continue onward and deal damage to another target. Standard cannon shells deal significant damage to a single target and have large piercing potential, while explosive cannon shells damage all targets in an area which makes them useful for dealing with large enemy groups. There are uranium versions of both shell types which deal even more damage. History 2.0.7 : Added an equipment grid. Added logistics requests, made available by the Logistic system (research) .

It, along with the car and tank , is one of three non-rail vehicles in Factorio. It's equipped with four fast-firing rocket launchers capable of manual or automatic targeting. It can be driven manually or remotely controlled using the spidertron remote . Furthermore, it has an equipment grid which accepts all equipment modules . Spidertron's legs can be moved by belts which can be prevented by inserting belt immunity equipment into its equipment grid. The vehicle can be renamed, and its color can be changed independently of the color of the player that is riding inside it. This color and name are shown in the tooltip of all connected spidertron remotes . Additionally, the spidertron's inventory can have logistics requests and auto-trash filters set up, similar to the player inventory, so the vehicle is automatically supplied by logistic robots . Picking up the vehicle keeps the modules inside its equipment grid, its name, its color and the logistics requests saved in the item, however any content from the spidertron's inventory is placed into the player's inventory and not saved in the item. Contents 1 Combat 2 Speed 3 Trivia 4 Gallery 5 Achievements 6 History 7 See also Combat The four spidertron rocket launchers operate in \"chain mode\" which allows rapid firing of rockets at enemies. The spidertron can be set to automatically target enemies, both with or without any passengers inside the spidertron. The spidertron's combat capabilities are enhanced by its equipment grid, e.g. energy shields can be equipped to increase its protection or personal laser defenses can be used for higher killing power. The spidertron's equipment modules are used additionally to any modules that the riding player may have equipped in their own power armor . Speed Unlike the car and tank, which are affected by the surfaces they travel on, the spidertron's speed does not change on different surfaces. Due to the way the spidertron travels, its speed slightly fluctuates and does not consistently stay at its top speed. The spidertron does not take any fuel , therefore its speed can be only increased by equipping exoskeletons into its grid. Up to 5 exoskeletons can fit in the vehicle's grid. The top speeds (in km/h) are as follows: Equipment Top speed Default ~46 1 exoskeleton ~57 2 exoskeletons ~68 3 exoskeletons ~85 4 exoskeletons ~90 5 exoskeletons ~102 Trivia The spidertron was first mentioned in the Friday Facts #120 , however it was not introduced into the game and did not appear on the roadmap. After FFF #120 the spidertron was sometimes hidden in other Friday Facts such as FFF #200 , FFF #315 and FFF #330 . However, the spidertron was not developed further after its first mention: \"Than maybe he felt FFF was too short that week, so he made the gif, and it was not touched ever since\". It was then introduced in version 1.0.0 as a surprise feature, more than 4 years after it was first teased. The spidertron is the only item in the game to require raw fish as a crafting ingredient. It is not known for certain why this is the case, although it could be to limit the automatability of spidertron production (since raw fish production is challenging to automate). In Space Age , the ingredients for a spidertron are shared between Nauvis and Gleba . Both raw fish and the uranium-235 needed for the portable fission reactor can only be obtained on Nauvis, while the carbon fiber needed for rocket turrets can only be acquired on Gleba . As such, automating spidertron production requires regular transport between the two planets. A legendary spidertron with its equipment grid filled with 55 legendary toolbelt equipment modules has a total inventory size of 1575 slots.

Stack size 1 Prototype type spidertron-remote Internal name spidertron-remote The spidertron remote can be used to remotely control a spidertron . It can be created with ALT + A or by pressing the respective button on the shortcut bar after unlocking the spidertron research . First, the remote needs to be connected to spidertrons. This is done by, when holding a remote, holding Left mouse button and dragging over one or more spidertrons. Once a group of spidertrons is selected with a remote, clicking Right mouse button with the remote in the world or map view will prompt the connected spidertron(s) to move to the selected location. They will move to that location in a straight line from their current position, not attempting to pathfind around obstacles. A sequence of move commands can be queued by using SHIFT + Right mouse button with the remote in the world or map view. Queuing move commands allows creating complex paths for the spidertron. The queued goal positions and their connections are drawn in the spidertron's color both in the map view and in the world. Alternatively, SHIFT + Right mouse button with the remote can be used to command the spidertron(s) to follow a specific entity, such as a player or another vehicle . Once connected to spidertrons, the remote can be placed in the quickbar for easy access. Remotes placed here will remember its connected spidertron(s) and will remain in the quickbar even if the player dies. If playing in Space Age , a remote placed in the quickbar will remember its connected spidertron(s) even if the player is on another planet. It will also remember which planet those spidertrons are on. The remote's icon in the quickbar will gain a small overlay showing which planet the spidertron(s) are on, if that is not the same planet the player is currently viewing. Clicking the remote will instantly open the map and center the view on the connected spidertron(s), even if they are on a different planet.

They are one of two types of floating robotic devices, the other being construction robots . The basic movement speed of logistic robots is 0.05 tiles/tick (3 tiles per second) when they have enough power. When out of power, robots move at 20% of their current normal travel speed. This movement speed can be increased infinitely by the worker robot speed (research) . Logistic robots have no means of defending themselves and do not run when they encounter enemies. Despite being a floating entity, ground units using melee are still capable of destroying them. By default, each robot can only carry one item. This limit can be increased up to four items by the worker robot cargo size (research) . Robots consume power per tile traveled, additionally to consuming power per second spent in the air. When they run out of power, they have to recharge at a roboport , or a personal roboport , depending on where the robots were originally placed. Alternatively, they can be mined out of the air by the player which restores their internal power buffer, allowing the player to redeploy them immediately. Contents 1 Notes 2 Achievements 3 History 4 See also Notes Logistic robots will pick up items in the following priority: active provider chests > storage chests , buffer chests > passive provider chests Logistic robots will begin to fill storage chests from active provider chests if there are no other tasks available. The filter that can be set on the storage chest is respected even if items that are actively being pushed to the network can not be stored anywhere else. If a logistic robot carrying an item is unable to deliver its cargo (e.g. if the player moves out of range), it will drop its cargo in a storage chest before moving to other tasks. Logistic bots are slightly slower than construction robots , and cost more advanced materials to craft Note that researching more robot speed will also increase the robots' energy consumption.

Contents 1 Mechanics 2 Achievements 3 History 4 See also Mechanics Construction robots accomplish various tasks, including: They repair damaged entities using repair packs . They replace destroyed entities as long as they are available in a provider chest or storage chest . They remove entities marked with the deconstruction planner . Removed entities are transported into storage chests; if a requester / buffer chest has an unfulfilled logistics request for the item being deconstructed then construction bots will prioritise placing items directly in to these chests. This includes environmental entities such as fish and trees ; cliffs can be \"deconstructed\" if a construction robot has access to cliff explosives in a provider or storage chest in their network, or in the player's inventory. They add entities marked with a blueprint or placed as ghosts as long as these entities are available.  Entities are fetched from the closest logistic chest. They can carry up to four items at once, depending on the researched worker robot cargo size . They can use the items to build up to four tiles at once, but they can only build one entity at a time. Construction robots have no means of defending themselves and do not run when they encounter enemies. Because they often operate at the \"front\", they are in high danger to be destroyed. Despite being a floating entity, ground units using melee are still capable of destroying them, and any fire (such as ones from flamethrower turrets ) can also damage them. Researching more cargo or more speed for the logistic bots are also valid for the construction robots. Note that more speed will also increase the robots' energy consumption.

Logistic robots will pick up items from this chest to move them to requester chests , buffer chests , the player , or storage chests . Logistic robots will actively attempt to move all items within an active provider chest to storage chests when there are no other tasks available. Active provider chests have the highest priority as pick-up points for logistic robots when fulfilling requests. The main use-case for active provider chests is to be the output for a production building or process that cannot afford to back up due to outputs not being consumed fast enough. One clear example is with nuclear reactors . A reactor will not start a new cycle if its output is not cleared of depleted uranium fuel cells . By putting them in an active provider chest, logistics robots will frequently remove such cells, ensuring that the chest will only fill up if there is insufficient logistics storage for such fuel cells. Active provider chests are designed to be emptied. If the player does not want the contained items to be moved until they are specifically requested, then the passive provider chest or buffer chest can be used instead.

It emits an area of 50×50 tiles, in which logistic robots can interact with logistic network entities, such as storage chests , or requester chests . Additionally, a 110×110 tile area is created for construction robots to repair, construct or remove structures. This can be seen by hovering the mouse on a roboport, or logistics chest which is inside the logistic zone. The smaller orange square represents the reach of the logistics network where both logistics and construction robots can move. The larger green square represents the extent of the construction network where only construction robots can move. Robots placed into the air from the player's inventory inside of a roboport's coverage will seek out the nearest roboport to charge and rest. Two or more roboports can connect to form a logistic network , if the borders of the orange logistic areas touch. This is shown by a dotted line running between the two ports. An example of this can be seen on the bottom-right. Non-connected roboports will not share robots.

Repair packs inside a roboport are available for all robots and requester chests inside the logistic zone of that roboport. Construction bots, when provided with repair packs, will automatically repair all damaged structures inside of a roboport's coverage area. If a roboport is full of robots, robots attempting to rest will find a different roboport, if one is available. It's possible to request idle robots from other roboports by configuring corresponding requests in the roboport GUI. This way it's possible to request one type or quality of robot, then remove them from the roboport with a filtered inserter, to gradually clean a logistics network from this type of robot. Roboport GUI Power usage Roboports have 4 chargers, which are used to recharge the flying bots. More roboports in a small area will allow for greater charging throughput, if a lot of robots need charging. Robots waiting to be charged will float in place near the roboport and wait their turn. Robots will not enter a roboport to rest unless they have full charge. Robots with low/no charge can still fly, but will move extremely slowly. Interaction with personal roboports An entity with an equipment grid (usually a character wearing armor that grants one, but also a tank or spidertron ) equipped with a personal roboport or personal roboport MK2 can act as a mobile roboport. This mobile roboport uses the associated entity's own inventory rather than the local logistic network for robot, item and repair pack storage. The network it creates is separate from the static network; it doesn't share robots or items with other networks. Since it only has one inventory, a personal robot network has no use for logistic robots. It has no associated logistic network ; the entity's logistic requests and trash slots instead form part of whatever logistic network the entity is standing in, and are serviced by that network's robots. However, its construction robots will cooperate with other networks in getting construction tasks achieved as quickly as possible. History 2.0.7 : Roboports have built-in radar coverage of 2 chunks.

Many lamp colors. The lamp is a basic electric device providing light to a medium area (10 tile radius) at night. It can be used to increase visibility in a factory, so nightvision is not needed. Lamps can be toggled to always be on, regardless of time of day. Contents 1 Color 2 Trivia 3 History 4 See also Color Lamp colors can be changed by customizing the color with RGB values. This can also be done by sending a color signal to the lamp. When the condition inside the lamp passes, instead of lighting up white, it will use that color. This can be used to create colored displays, or indicate status. If more than one color signal is received, precedence is given to them in the order below (i.e. if red and green are received, the lamp will light red). As of now, attempting to use grey or black signals will just dim the lamp's light range, making those signal colors somewhat useless. When attached to a circuit, and the \"Use colors\" option is selected, the lamp can be configured to use color mapping, which controls the lamp's output based on color signals passed to it, or color components can be used, which are specified by red, blue and green signals separately. A packed RGB value can also be used, which uses an eight digit hex color for the color. The lamp can appear as black when the color components option is used while being turned off. Trivia Circuit-controlled lamps have a significantly reduced light range.

Each arithmetic combinator can perform any one of the following mathematical operations on signals, and will show the corresponding symbol on its top: addition ( + ) subtraction ( − ) multiplication ( * ) division ( / ) modulo ( % ) exponentiation ( ^ ) bit shift left ( << ) bit shift right ( >> ) bitwise AND ( & ) bitwise OR ( | ) bitwise XOR ( ^ ) The arithmetic combinator accepts two input connections (red and green wires), and sends its output to both output connections. The input wires connect to the nubs on the left side of the sprite in the sidebar, while the outputs connect to the right side. Contents 1 Function 2 Notes on operations 3 History 4 See also Function The operands can be any single signal or a constant value. Up to one of the operands can be the each virtual signal . For each signal operand, the input wires can be selected. If both wires are selected, the inputs are summed. If neither operand is the each signal, the output must be a single signal. The operation is performed on the values of the chosen left and right signals, and the result is sent to the output on the specified signal. If one operand is the each signal, then the output can be a single signal or the each signal. If the output is the each signal, then the operation is performed individually on the value of each input signal along with the value of the other operand, and each result is sent to the output on the same signal. If the output is a single signal, the operation is done on each of the input signals, the individual results are all added together, and that result is sent to the output on the specified signal. Notes on operations When using division , the result is truncated: 21 / 10 = 2 19 / 10 = 1 −21 / 10 = −2 −19 / 10 = −1 21 / −10 = −2 19 / −10 = −1 −21 / −10 = 2 −19 / −10 = 1 Modulo , indicated using % as it is in most programming languages, is the remainder after division. For example, 13 % 3 is 1 (13 = 4 * 3 + 1). This can, for example, be combined with truncated division as described above to separate out individual digits of a number for use in building visual indicators: (24321 / 10000) % 10  = 2 (24321 / 1000) % 10  = 4 (24321 / 100) % 10  = 3 (24321 / 10) % 10  = 2 (24321 / 1) % 10  = 1 Negating the left operand of a modulo negates the result, while negating the right operand does nothing: 13 % 3 = 1 13 % −3 = 1 −13 % 3 = −1 −13 % −3 = −1 Bit shift right and Bit shift left deal with numbers in the binary representation. The 0's and 1's that make up a number are shifted in the specified direction which can result in a completely different number, due to the change in the binary value. The shift performed is called arithmetic shift, because it preserves the sign bit on bit shift right.\nIf shifting left, a 0 is inserted into the least significant bit (LSB), and the bit in the most significant bit (MSB) is lost.\nIf shifting right and the number is positive (MSB=0), a 0 is inserted into the MSB and the bit in the LSB is lost.\nIf shifting right and the number is negative (MSB=1), a 1 is inserted into the MSB to keep the sign and the bit in the LSB is lost. Example of a 'bit shift left'. Example of a 'bit shift right (positive number)'. Example of a 'bit shift right (negative number)'. History 2.0.7 : Received a UI overhaul.

It is used to make comparisons of signals on the network. Function The decider combinator allows specifying a list of conditions on the left side of the GUI and a list of outputs on the right side of the GUI. Generally whenever the conditions are satisfied the outputs are activated. A condition consists of a \"first\" input signal, a comparison (>, <, =, >=, <=, !=), and a \"second\" input signal or constant. Additionally, for each input signal the input wires to read the signal from can be specified. If both red and green are checked, the input values are summed. If more than one condition is added, it is possible to change the connection of those using the logical operators AND and OR. An AND condition will result in true if all terms are true. An OR condition will return true if at least one of the terms is true. Each output has the option to specify a constant value, or to take the input count from specified wires. If both red and green are checked, the input values are summed. The decider combinator can handle logic signals . The following table shows how different combinations of logic signals can be used: Different output results when the conditions pass Input → No Each condition Each condition present ↓ Output Everything Evaluated on every signal that has a non-zero sum on the selected wires - Anything Evaluated on one signal that has a non-zero sum on the selected wires Evaluated on one signal that passes the Each conditions Each - Evaluated on Each passing signal Specific signal Evaluated on the specified signal Evaluated on Each passing signal, but the results are output on the specified signal instead wires can be selected even if a constant value is specified With both the arithmetic and decider combinator, there is one tick (60th of a second) of latency before the output signal is ready to be used as an input into a circuit network.

It has four different modes of operation (or seven with Space Age enabled) to filter out various signals from an input wire. Function The selector combinator can select a signal to output from one of the following modes of operation: Select input In this mode, the combinator sorts its input signals by value and outputs one of them at the same value. Sort descending (default): The signal with the highest value is selected. Sort ascending : The signal with the lowest non-zero value is selected. Index : Determines which position among the sorted values is selected, starting at 0, i.e. first (0), second (1), third (2). If multiple signals are provided and index is out of bounds, then no signal is passed through. The valid bounds is 0 through 1 less the total quantity of input signals. If a single input signal is provided, it is always passed through even if the index is out of bounds. Count inputs The combinator will count and output the number of unique inputs on the selected signal. The value of the input signals is not considered. Random input The combinator will pass through a random input signal every certain number of game ticks . By default, the combinator will update this every 1 tick, or 60 times per second. If there is only one input signal, it will be output after this threshold is met. If the input is removed before that happens, nothing will be output. Stack size The combinator will output the stack sizes of the input items. The combinator will not output any fluid or virtual signals . The value of the input items is not considered. Rocket capacity The combinator will output the rocket capacity of the input signals. The combinator will not output any fluids, virtual signals, or items too heavy for a rocket (the atomic bomb and rocket silo .) The value of the input items is not considered. Quality filter The combinator will pass through any input signals that meet a conditional against a certain quality grade. The combinator can compare an input's quality that is greater than, less than, equal to, greater or equal to, less or equal to, or not equal to, any one quality grade. If comparing against any quality grade, the only valid comparison is equal to . Quality transfer The combinator will take the selected target signal from its inputs and output it with a particular quality grade. If direct selection is selected, the combinator will attach the specified quality grade to the target signal, but only if that target signal is among the inputs. If select from input is selected, the combinator will search for the selected item within its inputs and apply the quality of selected input to the target signal, but only if both the selected input and the target signal are among the inputs.

The machine can be controlled by circuit and logistics networks. The machine does not require energy itself and does not limit the throughput of the electrical network. Contents 1 Mechanics 2 Gallery 3 History 4 See also Mechanics The power switch has two sides on which copper cables may be attached. The switch can be either on or off. Sparks are emitted from the machine while on and electricity may flow between the copper cables attached to it, in either direction. Copper cables can be attached to the sides of a power switch by holding them and using the left mouse button on the switch. The switch has no effect if other connections between the two sides exist. Cables may have to be isolated manually using methods such as clearing all cables on an electric pole by holding shift while using the left mouse button. Another method of isolating cables is to remove individual cables from electric poles by holding copper cable and using the left mouse button on the poles it's connected to. The power switch may be opened in map view, which allows the player to toggle it on or off from a distance. Gallery Two areas of an electric system held with a power switch.

It can be connected to the circuit network to produce an alert when a signal drops below a certain value, for example. GUI and configuration It can be toggled whether the sound plays globally so that it can be heard anywhere on the map, or locally so it will only be audible in the immediate vicinity of the speaker. As a courtesy, only enable global play on multiplayer when it is important that all players be notified. Only 50 sounds can be heard at once due to a game limitation. The volume of the programmable speaker can be controlled in the GUI. This determines the audio volume, and the carry distance if global playback is unticked. The range at full volume appears to be 64 tiles. As well as playing a sound, it can also be set to send a GUI text alert so the player can see what has caused the alarm. Both text and an icon can be specified, as seen in the check mark image above. In order to show an alert in players' GUIs, \"Show alert\" must be ticked. Additional options will be shown that allow the player to select an icon and text for the alert. The \"Allow polyphony\" check-box determines whether more than one sound may be played at once. Essentially, when hooking up a constant signal to a programmable speaker, with polyphony enabled, sounds will repeat extremely rapidly. (10 per second or so) Without polyphony, this is limited to about 1 per half second. Disabling polyphony is useful to avoid alerts being spammed and causing hearing damage. However, if producing music, polyphony may be needed. The \"Circuit value is pitch\" check-box allows dynamically changing the pitch of the sound created by changing the circuit value. This is useful for music production. If the player simply wants a sound to be created whenever the conditional is met, they should disable this check-box.

Almost every single icon in the game can be shown on a display panel, including the quality of an item. Descriptions can also be added to these entities. If connected to the circuit network , the display panel can be set up to showcase different icons and messages depending on what conditional signals are being passed to it. If a description is included in a display panel, hovering the mouse over it will display all lines of text. There is an option that allows for the first line of a description to always be displayed above the entity even when not selected. If this option is unselected, no text will appear above the entity unless the player hovers their mouse over it. There is a second option that allows the chosen icon and first line of a description to be shown on the minimap and remote view. It is worth noting that, unlike lamps or speakers , display panels do not use any power, and do not require electric network coverage at all. Circuit network functionality Besides being able to show static icons and text, display panels can be connected to the circuit network. This allows the player to specify a list of simple conditions and display settings. Conditions are evaluated in order, from top to bottom, showing the icon and text of the first one that matches. If none match, the display turns off. Conditions and display settings also offer logic signals as an option. However, only the Anything ( ) signal is meaningful as an output icon. Everything and Anything signals work as a left-side condition operand as expected, satisfying the condition same as a decider combinator would. When used as an output icon, however, Everything ( ) and Each ( ) always display the logic signal icon itself. When the Anything logic signal is used for both the condition and the output icon, it displays the first signal that passes the condition (first based on default sorting order regardless of the signal's actual value). When Anything is used as the output icon with any other condition, it displays itself. At most there can be a maximum of 100 conditional messages, adding more is not possible. Trying to import a blueprint with more will give the error message \"Too many messages.\" and yields an empty blueprint. History 2.0.7 : Introduced.

Recipes in which they are used include the two advanced types of furnace (meaning they are used in research), as well as more advanced stone products, notably concrete . It is more material efficient to use concrete for paths, as double the amount of tiles are produced from the same amount of stone. Stone path increases walking speed by 30% and reduces vehicle rolling resistance, allowing for improved acceleration and top speed. However, any type of path practically prevents pollution absorption by terrain, so extensive use of paths may cause the factory's pollution to spread farther.

Ice platforms can be used to replace Aquilo 's ammonical seas with a dense ice float similar to how landfill works on other planets. However, in order to support the operation of many of the game's buildings, it requires additional paving with concrete variants. The recipe for producing ice platforms uses the same inputs as the ammonical separation recipe outputs, but it consumes those outputs in a different ratio, resulting in a net increase in ammonia . That makes this recipe a possible way to get rid of any excess ice in lieu of recyclers . History 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

    "title": "Blueprint",
    "content": "Blueprint Edit Stack size 1 Prototype type blueprint Internal name blueprint Blueprints are items that contain building layouts. Blueprints are used to 'copy & paste' parts of a factory. Built areas can be selected for inclusion in a blueprint. When a blueprint is placed, a ghost of the layout appears on the ground. This can be used as a guide for manually placing factory pieces, or, more commonly, handed over to construction robots for automated completion. Blueprints can be stored in a blueprint book or blueprint library to prevent them occupying inventory space or for organization or sharing purposes. Contents 1 Achievements 2 Usage 2.1 Create a blueprint 2.2 Blueprint icon setup 2.3 Placing the blueprint 2.4 Viewing and clearing a blueprint 2.5 Parameterisation 3 Importing/Exporting blueprints 4 Additional information 5 Trivia 6 History 7 See also Achievements Automated construction Construct 100 machines using robots . You are doing it right Construct more machines using robots than manually. Usage Blank blueprints can be crafted by clicking the ( ) button in the shortcut bar . The blank blueprint can now be used to 'copy' a set of buildings. For example, copying this small gun turret defense setup: Create a blueprint To create a blueprint select the blueprint item out of the toolbar or the inventory.\nWith the blueprint icon shown next to the mouse cursor, click and hold the left mouse button and drag a box as large as needed (which can be cancelled by pressing Q ). All player-placed entities which will be included in the blueprint will be highlighted with a green square.\nOnce everything you intend to 'copy' is inside the drag box, release the mouse button and the 'Blueprint icon setup' menu will open. Blueprint icon setup On the top left of the \"Setup new blueprint\" menu there are four icon slots. These are displayed on the blueprint's icon and can be used to quickly identify a blueprint. When creating a new blueprint, the game automatically selects some of the icons representing the entities in the blueprint. These default icons can be changed by simply clicking on the icons to choose the desired ones. On the left the 'Total' number of components included in the blueprint is shown. The purple \"Parameterise\" button in the top right is used to configure the settings of any buildings or circuit network entity within the blueprint. More on this feature below. The green \"Create blueprint\" button creates the blueprint. Additionally, blueprint creation can be cancelled by clicking the X in the top right corner. Canceling the blueprint does not consume the blueprint item. The created blueprint will replace the empty blueprint in the player's cursor. Placing the blueprint To use/place the created blueprint select it from the tool belt or inventory. The process of placing a blueprint is very similar to that of using copy and paste functionality. When you select a blueprint, the whole building setup of the blueprint will be shown at your mouse cursor. In this case the Blueprint was renamed to \"Example blueprint\". The blueprint can be rotated using the R key. H will flip it horizontally; V will flip it vertically. Note that blueprints which contain rail signals , chain signals , or train stops cannot be flipped, only rotated. Placing a blueprint creates ghost entities. If these are within the green (or orange) 110×110 tiles area of a roboport , or within range of a personal roboport installed in modular armor or spidertron , construction robots may be able to build them using available materials. Holding Shift will activate \"Force Building\" mode. This will mark all trees and rocks underneath the blueprint for deconstruction, as well as place ghosts for landfill if building over water. If playing in Space Age , it will instead place ice platform or foundation , depending on what is appropriate for the current planet. Holding Control + Shift will activate \"Super Force Building\" mode. This acts the same as force building, but will also mark all other buildings for deconstruction. If building over transport belts , the game will attempt to place ghosts for underground belts of the same tier, if possible. After the blueprint gets placed somewhere, the buildings are placed as ghost buildings. Construction robots will now start to pick up the needed items from the construction network/the player inventory (if using a personal roboport) and place them at the ghost buildings. The required items need to be in the network in an active provider chest , a passive provider chest , a buffer chest or a storage chest . Blueprints can be placed from map view as long as the area has been explored. Viewing and clearing a blueprint Right clicking on a blueprint allows you to view, edit and clear it.\nBy clearing it, it will become blank so it can be set again. Parameterisation Nearly everything in the game that can be configured can also be parameterised within a blueprint. Settings which would have had to be changed manually one at a time can be set automatically with a single selection during blueprint construction. This allows for more generic blueprints which can be specifically configured for a particular need.\nSome settings which can be parameterised include, but are not limited to: Recipes in buildings Output control signals for the circuit network Icons, their values, and constants within combinators and their descriptions Rich text tags within the names of train stops , among other buildings The following example will demonstrate parameterisation with a constant combinator: In the above image, we have an iron plate signal with a value of 5, a copper plate signal with a value of 10, and a virtual signal \"A\" with a value of 1. By clicking the purple parameterisation button in the top right of the blueprint setup screen, we get the parameterisation GUI: There is a separate parameter for each unique signal and their values. Hovering the mouse over each value will tell you the origin of each signal. The above image shows that the iron plate signal has a value of 5 in a constant combinator. This is very useful if the blueprint contains multiple buildings with many different parameters. If there are two different signals with the same value, or multiple sources of the same signal, that value or signal is treated as a single parameter. There are several ways we can play with the values of the combinator. In order to be able to be modified, the \"Parameter\" checkbox next to a signal or value must be ticked. Further, these parameters can be reordered by clicking and dragging the bars on the far right. Reordering does play an important part in more advanced uses. In the above image, the iron and copper icons have been replaced with special parameter icons. These signals can be chosen upon building the blueprint. Whatever signals are chosen will inherit the original signal values of 5 and 10, respectively. Each parameter can be given a name, which will show up when building the blueprint. This is optional, but recommended. Clicking \"Ingredient of\" will allow us to select a parameter icon of an above parameter icon. This is why the order of the parameters is important. In our example, if Parameter 0 is set to, say, steel plate , Parameter 1 will automatically set itself to whatever the ingredient of that item is: in this case, iron plate . It is important to have enough available parameters for the number of ingredients. If we were to set Parameter 0 to instead electronic circuit , Parameter 1 would do nothing, as there are two ingredients to that item. A parameter will always choose the default recipe of an item as listed in the Factoriopedia. Alternate recipes such as those added in Space Age will not be considered. A parameter that is a constant can set as a parameter, and given an optional variable. In the above image, the Iron Value of 5 has been set as a parameter, which will be set separately from the signal itself. Giving a constant an optional variable allows itself to be used in a formula for a later constant. In the above image, the Copper Value of 10 has been set as a parameter, and given the variable \"x\". The variable can be anything, but it's best to keep it as something simple. Further, our \"A Value\" value of 1 is selected as a parameter, and the formula box is checked. There are several formulas available. Hovering the mouse over the formula box will show a list of available formulas given the current blueprint. In this example, the \"A Value\" constant can be set based on the stack size or rocket capacity of whatever Parameter 0 or 1 comes out to be. We can also use our variable \"x\" from above. We can type in basic mathematical operators like +, -, *, and /. This example uses the formula \"x*2\", meaning the A Value constant will be set to double whatever variable \"x\" turns out to be. Once finished configuring it, we press the green button, which saves our settings. The blueprint can now be placed. With our example, doing so will bring up the following box. We are given options to configure both the original iron plate signal, and the value of the copper plate signal. The other signals are determined by what we input in these two boxes. This example goes with a steel plate and a value of 8. Building this will give the following result. Our original iron plate signal is now steel plate, with its original value of 5. Our original copper plate signal is now iron plate with a value of 8, as that is the sole ingredient of steel plates Our \"A\" signal has stayed the same, but its value is now 16, which is double the variable \"x\", which we set to be 8 Normally, the purple parameter icons are only available in the parameterisation GUI. Alternatively, if the \"show parameters in selection lists\" option is enabled under game Setting > Interface > Interaction, parameters 0 through 9 become available as virtual signals under the \"Unsorted\" tab to expedite the process of setting up a parameterised blueprint. Importing/Exporting blueprints It is possible to export blueprints as a text string and import said text string to create a new blueprint. This makes sharing blueprints between players very easy. Clicking the Export to string button ( ) in the top right of the blueprint edit window will pop up a window containing the Blueprint string . This string can be copied to the operating system clipboard, from where it could be saved to a text file or uploaded to a website. To import a blueprint, the player can click the Import string icon on the shortcut bar ( ). A dialogue box will appear into which the string can be pasted. This will result in a blueprint appearing on the hand with the same setup as the one that was exported. The text string itself is a base64 encoded, compressed JSON string which contains all the information of the blueprint. It is therefore possible to decode/decompress the text string, change attributes of the blueprint in the JSON text and finally re-encode/compress it back to the known text string format. This basically allows blueprint editing outside of the game itself. A complete explanation of the blueprint JSON can be found on the blueprint string format page. Additional information Once a blueprint is created, it can be used an unlimited amount of times. To place a blueprint that is blocked by existing buildings, you can hold Shift to place the objects that aren't blocked. The above trick will also mark rocks and trees for deconstruction. Buildings marked for destruction will not block placing a blueprint. The blueprinted building cannot be placed if there are any buildings in the way. This can cause an item outside the construction zone to block construction of a 2×2 building on the edge of the zone. The maximum of size a blueprint is 10k by 10k tiles .

    "content": "Deconstruction planner Edit Using an unfiltered deconstruction planner to queue orders for construction robots . Stack size 1 Prototype type deconstruction-item Internal name deconstruction-planner The deconstruction planner is an item which allows the player to mark tiles and entities, including trees , rocks , cliffs , fish and items on the ground, for removal. By default, tiles are only marked when no entities are found. Tiles or entities queued for deconstruction will be marked with a red 'X'. When within the range of construction robots they will be removed by the robots and the resulting items stored in logistic network chests or, when a personal roboport is used, the player's inventory. Ghosts will be removed immediately. Anything marked for deconstruction will immediately stop functioning. Deconstruction orders can be cancelled prior to the removal of the target. The deconstruction planner can be used unfiltered (blank) to remove all entities or tiles within its selection area, or it can be filtered to specific targets. Deconstruction planners, just like blueprints , can be stored in a blueprint book or blueprint library to prevent them occupying inventory space or for organization or sharing purposes.

(Available once construction robotics is researched in at least one game.) Pressing the keyboard shortcut assigned to Make new deconstruction planner ; default: ALT + D . Importing a deconstruction planner string . Once a new planner is in the hand it can be used immediately and then deleted by pressing Q to clear the hand. Alternatively, it can be dropped into the player's inventory for later use. Once in the inventory it can be pinned to a quickbar slot. Accessing settings The planner must be in an inventory in order for its configuration to be changed. Settings can be accessed by clicking Right mouse button on a planner's icon, either in the inventory or on a quickbar link. A full description of available settings and filters can be found under configuration and filtering . Deleting a planner A planner that has been stored in an inventory can be deleted by clicking the red trash-can icon labelled Destroy deconstruction planner ( ) in the top right of its settings window. Care should be taken when the planner has been configured as this operation is performed immediately without confirmation and cannot be undone. Using the deconstruction planner With a planner held in the hand the player can click-drag it ( Left mouse button is held down while moving the mouse) over existing structures and ghosts to mark them for deconstruction. A tooltip appears indicating what will be removed. The planner can be used anywhere on the map where the player has radar coverage (map view). Once Left mouse button is released the deconstruction planner will take effect according to the rules listed below. Dragging a deconstruction planner. The tooltip shows what will be removed. Red Xs indicate queued deconstruction orders. Ghosts were immediately removed. Effects of deconstruction The following describes the possible results of using a deconstruction planner in the game world: Any selected entity ghosts and tile ghosts will be immediately removed. Any selected entities and tiles will be queued for deconstruction, indicated with a red X. Anything queued for deconstruction will stop functioning; for example transport belts will stop moving, assembling machines will cease producing items, walls stop connecting to each other, and so on. Laser and gun turrets will continue functioning even when marked for deconstruction. If the deconstruction orders are within the construction area of construction robots the orders will be added to the bots' queue and will be removed in due course: Bots will fly in and remove all entities and tiles and place the resulting items in logistic network chests, or the player's inventory when the bots flew from a personal roboport. Where there are items to be removed - for example being carried by transport belts or stored inside a chest or assembling machine - these will also be picked up by bots and placed in the appropriate storage. Items must be removed before the entities that carry or hold them. For example if a wooden chest holding 500 iron plates is marked for removal, the plates will be picked up first and only when all have been removed will the bots deconstruct the chest itself. Environmental entities such as trees, rocks and fish are handled in the same way, except bots mine them and collect and store the resource items they leave behind. Cliffs are a special case: they are destroyed by bots carrying cliff explosives and do not yield any item to be stored. Cancelling deconstruction orders Queued deconstruction orders can be cancelled by holding SHIFT while click-dragging a deconstruction planner over the affected area. When SHIFT is held down the area selection border will change from red to blue to indicate cancellation mode is in effect. Undo The undo tool can be used to revert the actions of a deconstruction planner. This applies both to pending deconstruction orders and completed removals. Undo is triggered by pressing CTRL + Z (on macOS: Command + Z ) Performing an undo will cancel any queued removal orders (red Xs) that have not yet been actioned. Any ghosts that were removed will be immediately replaced. Where built entities and tiles have already been removed the undo will reinstate them in the form of new ghosts that can then be re-built by any construction robots in range. Items that were removed as part of the deconstruction - for example the inventory of chests or items carried by a transport belt - will not be restored by an undo. This means that a deconstruction that consisted exclusively of items, for example picking up stone from the ground, cannot be undone. It is also not possible to undo the removal of trees, rocks, cliffs and fish. Cancelling deconstruction orders by dragging with Shift held down. The entities start working when the deconstruction is cancelled. Using then undoing a deconstruction planner. Deconstruction markers are cancelled, ghosts re-appear, and removed entities are reinstated as new ghosts for bot rebuilding. Valid targets Harvesting fish with a deconstruction planner. The deconstruction planner can remove player-built entities, entity ghosts , tiles, tile ghosts and loose items. In addition, it can remove trees , rocks , cliffs and fish . Tiles Tiles are treated differently to entities, entity ghosts and tile ghosts. By default a deconstruction planner will not select any tiles unless the area selected contains only tiles; whenever one or more entities, entity ghosts or tile ghosts is included, tile selection is disabled. This is done to allow the player to use a deconstruction planner to remove entities that are placed on top of path tiles (such as concrete ) without the floor always being removed as well. When the user wishes to select tiles in areas where other objects also exist the deconstruction planner configuration must be changed as described in the next section. Environmental entities These are handled in the same way as entities and tiles placed by the player: they are marked with a red X and construction robots will remove them. A difference with environmental entities is that bots will collect resources rather than the entity itself, such as wood from trees and stone from rocks. The removal of cliffs requires that the bots have access to cliff explosives. Cliffs do not leave behind any resource. The ability to use a deconstruction planner to remove and collect fish provides a convenient way for a player equipped with a personal roboport to replenish their stocks of healing items even in the middle of combat. Fish marked with a deconstruction planner will stop moving. Configuration and filtering An example of a filtered planner icon. A new deconstruction planner is blank, meaning it removes according to a pre-defined set of rules. The planner can optionally be edited to provide a custom list of removal rules which control which types of entities and tiles will - or won't - be removed. These rules are called filters. A filtered planner will show its filtered items on its icon. Up to the first four filters will be shown. Blank planner rules A blank planner will select: Any entities and entity ghosts, including trees, rocks, cliffs and fish; Tile ghosts; Or , if and only if no entities, entity ghosts and tile ghosts are found, it will instead select tiles. These rules are the base point from which a filtered planner can then be customized. Filter settings window The deconstruction planner interface is divided into two sections: entities and tiles . The entities tab. The tiles tab. A whitelist filter that removes only defensive structures. A blacklist filter that removes everything except roboports and power poles . Principles of filtering Each tab consists of 30 slots in which an entity or tile can be chosen. When one or more slots is filled the planner becomes filtered and will now act according to those filters. A set of filters is either a whitelist or blacklist, and this is set with a toggle at the top of each tab. The default is whitelist. In whitelist mode the planner will act only upon those items added to the filter slots - any entities and tiles not added as filters will be ignored by the planner. In blacklist mode the opposite applies: the planner will mark everything except the entities or tiles filtered on. Setting and removing filters Clicking any slot with Left mouse button will open the Set the filter window in which the desired item can be chosen. Alternatively, an item in the hand can be clicked into a slot to filter on that item. A filter is removed by clicking on a filled slot with Right mouse button . Entities tab In the entities tab the user can select items to filter from the follow categories: Environment Logistics Production Combat Unsorted The Environment tab lists all types of trees and rocks, plus cliffs and fish. Logistics, production and combat will be familiar to the player from the item selection window. Environment and unsorted are unique to the deconstruction planner. The environment tab lists cliffs, fish, and every individual kind of tree and rock. This facilitates filtering on specific environmental entities if desired. Trees/rocks only toggle At the top of the entities tab is the Trees/rocks only tick-box. With this enabled the deconstruction planner will filter on all kinds of trees and rocks from the Environment section, and the filter slots will be disabled. The Whitelist/Blacklist toggle is still in effect and controls whether the planner selects only trees and rocks, or selects everything but them. Fish and cliffs are not included in this filter. Special items in the Unsorted section The unsorted section provides four special items, each using a red X icon. Entity ghost: To filter on any type of entity ghost, separate from constructed entities. Item on ground: Loose items on the ground, such as dropped by the player, spilled from removing armor , and stones dropped from destroyed rocks . Does not include items on transport belts . Item request slot: Filters on the pending addition of items such as modules to assembling machine 2 or electric furnace . This would also target fuel queued for addition to a locomotive . Does not target items already installed, only those waiting to be added following the placement of a blueprint or as a result of an undo operation. Tile ghost: As with entity ghost, this will target tile ghosts separately from constructed tiles. If the user wants a deconstruction planner that only removes tile ghosts, they can place this item as an entity filter. If they want a filter that removes all types of tiles and tile ghosts, they should add Tile ghost under Entities and then set the Tiles tab drop-down to 'Always'. Tiles tab Clicking a filter slot will bring up the Set the Filter window showing the available tiles. Landfill is included in the list but the only function is to exclusively select landfill ghosts, as landfill cannot be removed once placed. At the top of the Tiles tab is a drop-down that controls constructed tile removal behavior. It has four options: Normal: The default. Constructed tiles are removed only when no entities, entity ghosts or tiles ghosts are found in the deconstruction area. Always: Constructed tiles are always removed, even if the deconstruction planner also selects entities or entity ghosts. Tile ghosts are not selected unless Tile ghost is added under the Entities tab. Never: Constructed tiles are never removed, even if they are the only object selected. Tile ghosts are not selected unless Tile ghost is added in the Entities tab. Only: Constructed tiles are always removed, and nothing else will be. Entities, entity ghosts and tile ghosts will be ignored. The Entities tab is effectively disabled when this mode is selected. The deconstruction planner always follows the settings of this drop-down, regardless of any filters set in the Tiles tab. For example if a user wishes to configure a planner that removes both walls and concrete , they must first set those filters in the Entities and Tiles tabs, and then also set the Tiles drop-down to Always . Without changing the drop-down the planner would only select concrete in places where no entities, entity ghosts or tile ghosts were found, as per the rules described under Normal in the above list. Exporting and importing with strings The settings for a deconstruction planner can be exported in string form. Clicking the Export to string button ( ) in the top right of the planner edit window will pop up a window containing the Deconstruction item string . This string can be copied to the operating system clipboard, from where it could be saved to a text file or uploaded to a website. To import a deconstruction planner the player can click the Import String icon on the shortcut bar ( ). A dialogue box will appear into which the string can be pasted. This will result in a deconstruction planner appearing on the hand with the same configuration as the one that was exported. The export/import process can be used to copy deconstruction planners between games and to other players. Achievements Automated cleanup Deconstruct 100 objects with the construction robots . Trivia In Space Age , it is possible to get a quality deconstruction planner by recycling them with quality modules . Quality planners function identically to their normal counterparts History 0.18.37 : Deconstruction planners can be inserted into blueprint books and the blueprint library. Deconstruction planners can now have custom icons specified.

    "content": "Upgrade planner Edit Using an unfiltered upgrade planner. Stack size 1 Prototype type upgrade-item Internal name upgrade-planner The upgrade planner is a tool for mass updating entities to alternative entities of the same size and type. It can be used on both placed structures and ghosts . It can also modify the contents of a blueprint . While most commonly used to upgrade entities to their higher tier equivalents - for example to replace transport belts with fast transport belts or fast inserters with bulk inserters - the upgrade planner is able to change a wide range of entities including transport belts , underground belts , splitters , inserters , assembling machines , chests , power poles , rail signals , modules , furnaces and more. Using an upgrade planner in the game world is similar to the operation of the deconstruction planner and blueprint, in that the player drags a rectangular area in which the upgrade planner will function and this results in orders being queued for construction robots . Upgrade planners can be used blank (unfiltered) to automatically apply a limited set of common upgrades. Alternatively they can be configured  (filtered) to make specific replacements. This can include downgrading higher tier, later-game entities to lower tier equivalents. Upgrade planners, just like blueprints , can be stored in a blueprint book or blueprint library to prevent them occupying inventory space or for organization or sharing purposes. Contents 1 Basic operation 1.1 Getting an upgrade planner 1.2 Using a planner in the game world 1.3 Cancelling updates 1.4 Updating blueprints 2 Upgrade planner filters 2.1 Using a blank upgrade planner (unfiltered) 2.2 Filtering an upgrade planner 2.2.1 The filter window 2.2.2 Editing the filters 3 Valid entities 3.1 Modded entities 4 Trivia 5 History 6 See also Basic operation Getting an upgrade planner A blank planner can be obtained by clicking the green upgrade planner icon ( ) on the shortcut bar (available once construction robotics has been researched in at least one game.) This will result in a blank upgrade planner appearing in the hand. It can be used immediately or placed in the inventory. It must be placed in the inventory before a filter can be applied and before it can be pinned to a quickbar slot. Using a planner in the game world With a planner held in the hand the player can click-drag it ( Left mouse button is held down while moving the mouse) over existing structures to mark them for upgrade. A tooltip appears indicating which entities will be changed and to what. Once Left mouse button is released yellow circles will appear over any existing structures that are now queued for update. These update operations will be performed by construction robots . The planner can be used anywhere on the map where the player has radar coverage (map view). Upgrade planners can also affect ghost entities. Any ghost eligible for update will immediately change to the new entity. Dragging an upgrade planner. The tooltip shows which upgrades will occur. Yellow circles indicate pending update operations. Ghost entities update immediately. Cancelling updates Pending upgrade operations can be cancelled by holding SHIFT while click-dragging the upgrade planner over the affected area. Updating blueprints Upgrade planners can also be used to change the contents of a blueprint. This allows the player to keep using the same blueprints as they research progressively better entities. As upgrade planners can also downgrade entities this further provides a way for a player to adjust late-game blueprints to make them suitable for re-use in subsequent games. The blueprint to be updated must reside in an inventory. It is not currently possible to use an upgrade planner in the blueprint library. With a planner held in the hand, the edit window for a blueprint should be opened by clicking Right mouse button on it. The upgrade planner can be applied by clicking Left mouse button on the grey upgrade planner slot in the top right corner of the blueprint. The entities in the blueprint will immediately update according to the filters in the planner. If a blank planner is used an automatic set of common upgrades is applied, as described in the next section. The update is immediate and cannot be undone, except by applying another upgrade planner with filters set to change back the affected entities. Upgrade planner filters A new upgrade planner is blank, meaning it lacks any configuration and will operate on a pre-defined set of upgrade rules. The planner can optionally be edited to provide a custom list of update rules that control which entities will be updated and what to. Using a blank upgrade planner (unfiltered) When a blank upgrade planner is used it operates on a specific list of entities considered automatically upgradable to the next highest tier. The list of entity types that can be affected by a blank planner are as follows: Belts Underground belts Splitters Inserters Assembling machines Furnaces Entities of the above types will be upgraded to the next highest tier where one exists. A complete list of the entities eligible for upgrade by a blank planner is found in Valid entities . Filtering an upgrade planner The planner must be in an inventory in order for it to be editable.  The filter window can be accessed by clicking Right mouse button on an upgrade planner, either in the inventory or on a quickbar link. The filter window The filter window consists of 24 entity slot pairs. In each pair the entity to be updated goes in the left slot and the entity it will be changed to goes in the right slot. A blank planner. A simple configuration example. Editing the filters A filter is applied by first clicking Left mouse button on the left-hand slot of any slot pair. This brings up the Select upgrade window. This is similar to the item selection window but is limited to displaying the entities an upgrade planner is able to change. The right-hand slot is then selected in the same way, choosing the target entity. The select upgrade window for the right slot will only show entities that are a valid update target for the entity in the left slot. When there is only one possible update target the right slot will be filled in automatically. Filters can be removed by clicking Right mouse button on the slot. Valid entities An example of downgrading. This could be helpful to make a blueprint usable from the beginning of a game. The upgrade planner can operate on the entities listed below. It can swap any entity in a given category to any other entity in the same category. For example a transport belt can be changed to a fast or express transport belt and also to any kind of underground belt , but not to a splitter or a chest . The Blank upgrade planner column indicates which entities will be automatically upgraded when a blank (unfiltered) upgrade planner is used. These entities will upgrade to the entity following them in the table. Category Entity Blank upgrade planner Belts and undergrounds Transport belt Yes Belts and undergrounds Fast transport belt Yes Belts and undergrounds Express transport belt No/Yes Belts and undergrounds Turbo transport belt No Belts and undergrounds Underground belt Yes Belts and undergrounds Fast underground belt Yes Belts and undergrounds Express underground belt No/Yes Belts and undergrounds Turbo underground belt No Splitters Splitter Yes Splitters Fast splitter Yes Splitters Express splitter No/Yes Splitters Turbo splitter No Inserters Burner inserter No Inserters Inserter Yes Inserters Fast inserter Yes Inserters Bulk inserter No Chests Wooden chest No Chests Iron chest No Chests Steel chest No Chests Active provider chest No Chests Passive provider chest No Chests Storage chest No Chests Buffer chest No Chests Requester chest No Power poles Small electric pole No Power poles Medium electric pole No Rail signals Rail signal No Rail signals Rail chain signal No Steam Engine/Turbine Steam engine No Steam Engine/Turbine Steam turbine No Furnaces Stone furnace Yes Furnaces Steel furnace No Assembling machines Assembling machine 1 Yes Assembling machines Assembling machine 2 Yes Assembling machines Assembling machine 3 No Modules Speed module No Modules Speed module 2 No Modules Speed module 3 No Modules Productivity module No Modules Productivity module 2 No Modules Productivity module 3 No Modules Efficiency module No Modules Efficiency module 2 No Modules Efficiency module 3 No Modules Quality module No Modules Quality module 2 No Modules Quality module 3 No With the Space Age DLC and the quality mod enabled, upgrade planners can also be set to upgrade entities to different qualities of the same entity. Modded entities Modded entities can also be valid entities for an upgrade planner. The filter selection window will expand to automatically include any modded entities compatible with the above categories. This can also result in extra categories being available for update, beyond those listed above. For example if a mod is installed that adds new types of lamp , it may become possible to update the vanilla lamp to one of the new modded lamps using an upgrade planner. Trivia In Space Age , it is possible to get a quality upgrade planner by recycling them with quality modules .

Just like blueprints and planners, it occupies a single inventory slot, but can contain an unlimited amount of any of them. Also just like them, it can be stored in the blueprint library to prevent inventory space usage or for sharing purposes. Blueprints can be used directly from the book item, and the currently active blueprint can be changed with SHIFT + Mouse wheel up and SHIFT + Mouse wheel down . If books are nested, this works as if every nested book was replaced by its contents: Upon switching to a nested book, that book is switched to the first (last) item it contains, and scrolling further switches through that nested book's items until its end, at which point the item that goes after the nested book is selected. A blueprint book can be created by clicking the ( ) button in the shortcut bar . It can be stored in player's inventory, in another book, or in the blueprint library. Any book or blueprint, even nested one, can also be placed in the quickbar , but it is just a \"shortcut\", the item itself stays wherever it was. A book can also be placed in any normal container, like a chest, but keeping it there disables the quickbar entry (if it was created) and increases the chances of destruction (e.g. by biter attack or careless tank driving). Blueprint book GUI. Shown above is the full blueprint book GUI window (includes player inventory on the left), which can be opened by right clicking the book item in any inventory (includes other books and blueprint library) or quickbar.

The two leftmost buttons in the row below chose between the list view (shown in this screenshot) and the more compact grid view (shown in the screenshot at the top of this page). The \"plus\" button creates a copy of the book. The result is a completely separate book, editing or deleting either one or their contents does not affect the other. The green button allows applying an upgrade planner to all entities in all blueprints in the book. The button between the green and the red exports the book as a string that can be imported with the \"Import string\" button on the shortcut bar.

It has two water connectors on opposite ends and passes water through to adjacent equipment such as other boilers. The boiler features a single output for the steam it produces. It only consumes fuel as it creates steam. Boilers used in conjunction with offshore pumps and steam engines are a vital part of early power generation . For each unit of water, 10 units of steam are produced. Inserting one coal (4 MJ) into a boiler then using the resulting steam in a steam engine will supply 4 MJ of energy to an electrical system. It costs 300 kJ to heat 1 unit of water to into 10 steam at 165°C, so one boiler will produce 60 steam per second. Inserters can insert fuel into boilers. However, using powered inserters to move fuel into a boiler can be problematic should fuel become unavailable: if no power is being produced, then powered inserters fueling a boiler cannot operate. Using at least one burner inserter , which uses fuel and not electricity, ensures that at least one inserter is available to restart a single boiler. Inserters can also remove fuel from boilers, allowing inserters to move fuel down a chain of boilers. History 2.0.7 : 1 Water will now produce 10 Steam in boilers/heat exchangers. 0.15.10 : Steam became a separate resource, boilers now produce steam rather than high temperature water that is displayed as steam This distinction is meaningful for circuit network accounting of steam and the coal liquefaction recipe 0.15.0 : New graphics.

They produce electricity by consuming steam , using water pumped from an offshore pump that was heated to 165°C steam with boilers or to 500°C steam with heat exchangers . Steam that has a higher temperature than the maximum temperature of the steam engine (165°C) is consumed at the normal rate (30 units/s), and does not yield more electricity. This means the energy that was put into the steam to heat it to a higher temperature is wasted. Steam engines will automatically adjust their power production and steam usage based on the current demands of the electricity network. Hovering the mouse over a steam engine will display their current power production ( Performance ) and their possible power production ( Available Performance ), in a display on the right. Steam engines have two ports, allowing excess steam to flow through. This allows steam engines to be chained together. The current optimal ratio is 1 offshore pump to 200 boilers to 400 steam engines. For more information, see power production . Using steam engines for power does not produce pollution , however using boilers to heat up the water does. On Aquilo , steam engines need to be heated up to working temperature before they will start working, but will still pass steam through when frozen. When producing power, the steam engine will display a working animation: History 0.18.18 : Adjusted steam engine and turbine collision boxes so player can walk between two steam engines. 0.15.0 : Steam is now internally a separate fluid from hot water .

Generated power will increase/decrease linearly during dawn and dusk, and no power is produced at night. The baseline power generated by a panel is 60 kW; this represents 100% power production. On Nauvis , one solar panel produces an average of 42 kW over a day/night cycle. In Space Age , different planets provide a bonus or penalty to panel output. These modifiers are based on 60 kW as the baseline 100% power of a panel. Planets also have their own day/night cycle lengths, so the average power produced by panels over a day/night cycle can change. Space platforms do not have day/night cycles; panels produce a constant amount of power while at a location in space. If a platform is moving between locations, the power output will raise or lower based on how far it is between the source location and destination. If the source location offers 200% solar power, and the destination has 300%, then a platform halfway between will have its solar panels offer 250% power. Quality panels also provide higher than 100% power output. Contents 1 Energy management 2 Notes 3 Space Age 4 Optimal ratios 5 Achievements 6 Gallery 7 History 8 See also Energy management As already stated, solar panels produce energy only during the day, but you likely want your factory to run at night as well. Accumulators can be charged up with solar panels during the day to power the base at night. Accumulators are not the only way to work with solar energy. Sometimes it is more economical to just avoid consuming energy at night. For example, if you power a bunch of electric mining drills and electric furnaces to produce iron and copper plates , you could build more drills and furnaces than you actually need, and store the excess metal production during the day. At night you can shut down the drills and furnaces, and let your factory run with the stored plates. Instead of storing energy, you would be storing what the energy is used for. The easiest way to achieve this is by connecting all your extractors and furnaces to an electric network with exactly enough solar panels to make them work during the day, and keeping this network away from your factory's main electric network. Notes A single (normal quality) solar panel outputs an average of 42 kW over a day on Nauvis and requires 0.84672 accumulators to sustain a constant power output through the night. It takes approximately 23.8 solar panels to operate 1 MW of factory and charge 20.2 accumulators to sustain that 1 MW through the night. The optimal ratio for normal quality solar panels to charge enough normal quality accumulators on Nauvis is 2646 accumulators for 3125 solar panels (supplying 42 kW per solar panel).

In Space Age, the closer a planet is to the sun, the more power a solar panel on its surface produces.

The accumulator can store up to 5 MJ of energy. Its maximum charge/discharge rate is 300 kW. If connected to a circuit network , an accumulator will output its level of charge, rounded to the nearest integer from 0 to 100, to a specified signal. Contents 1 Notes 2 Other uses 2.1 Isolation of Power Networks 2.1.1 Reduction of Energy Consumption in Critical Situations 3 History 4 See also Notes 5MJ of stored energy takes approximately 17s to fully charge/discharge at the maximum rate of 300kW. Read Time#Seconds for further time related calculations. It takes 20 accumulators (100MJ) to maintain 1MW through the night, because the accumulators don't immediately start discharging at the beginning of dusk, see the graph in this post. For balanced solar power, every 21 accumulators need to have 25 solar panels supporting them (at 50kW per accumulator) When discharged above maximum speed by multiple unconnected poles, energy will not be distributed equally (some loads may get 100% demand, others 0%) May be used to provide a limited amount of power (multiples of maximum charge rate) to a section of the grid. Produces light when charging and discharging. Can act as an emergency backup for the factory in case of blackout, until main power supply is restored. Can be used to power the base at night if it relies on solar panels . Can act to satisfy surging demands of certain loads. If the power usage of one device exceeds production for a few seconds or so, the accumulator can provide power to the grid until said device shuts down or requires a lesser power requirement. Other uses Note that if throughput should not be limited, a power switch can be used instead. Isolation of Power Networks Accumulators can be used to isolate two separate power networks, which has a number of uses. Since accumulators have a lower delivery priority than any other entity, this guarantees that they only receive energy when you have enough left over after powering all other entities in a network. At the same time, accumulators can also be used to deliver energy in another electrical network, and can charge and discharge at the same time. Consider the following example: Example of accumulators sharing two separate networks. (Click to enlarge) The two power networks A and B are not directly connected to each other: They are connected only through the accumulators, which are shared by both networks. This is accomplished by setting up electric poles for each network connected to the accumulators, then ensuring the sets of poles are not connected to each other (which can be done by crafting a copper wire then dragging it between two connected poles to sever the connection, exactly as is done for disconnecting circuit wires).  (As of 2.0, rather than crafted copper wire, the Make Copper Wire create tool in the UI -- near the Red & Green circuit wires -- is used.) In the above example: The accumulators will only charge if extra power is being produced by network A or B. The accumulators will discharge as needed into either network if one is not producing enough power. Since the maximum input/output rate of an accumulator is 300 kW, power flow between the two networks will be limited to 300 kW times the number of accumulators (1.5 MW in the example). Note that this isolation is bidirectional: Either network can charge the accumulators, and the accumulators can discharge into either network. This technique can be used whenever this type of isolation is desired. Reduction of Energy Consumption in Critical Situations In particular, one good use for the above technique is to limit electricity consumption in low power situations by isolating non-critical parts of your factory (such as Radar , Labs , Electric furnaces , electric miners , Beacons , etc.) from critical parts (such as lasers, ammo production, or whatever your priorities are). To do this, place your main generators and critical components on one network and place your non-critical components on another network, isolating the two as above. Now, two things will happen: Power will only flow to the non-critical network when you are generating a surplus on the main network, and The rate will always be limited to 300 kW per accumulator. Because the accumulators will only receive power if you have a surplus on the main network, this will in effect deactivate the low-priority network when electricity is in short supply. This will also limit power consumption of the low priority network if its usage becomes high, for example if you have two factories on a low priority network and usually only one of them runs at a time, if both happen to run they won't consume more than the total limit, they'll just slow down. Essentially you are saying \"only deliver power to these systems if I have enough to spare, and even then don't exceed this delivery rate\". In general this is a technique which works well when you've just researched accumulators and solar panels, but don't have enough resources to build big solar farms and accumulator farms yet.

The heat can be used in a heat exchanger to produce steam which can be used to generate power. Unlike other forms of power generation, it is load-independent – each fuel cell will always be used completely in 200 seconds, regardless of load or the temperature of the reactor. To prevent wasting fuel, the inserters feeding fuel to the reactors can read the heat level of a reactor via the circuit network , permitting them to only insert when the heat in the reactor is relatively low. Alternatively, excess power can be stored in accumulators or as steam in storage tanks . Instead of completely consuming the fuel, burning fuel in a nuclear reactor results in depleted uranium fuel cells . These used up cells can be reprocessed in a centrifuge to get back some of the uranium used to create the fuel cells. The reactor will not burn more fuel if it has too many depleted fuel cells, so they must be removed. Nuclear reactors have a heat capacity of 10 MJ/°C. Thus, they can buffer 5 GJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, and require 4.85 GJ of energy to warm up from 15°C to 500°C when initially placed. Contents 1 Neighbour bonus 1.1 Double-row layout 1.2 Square layout 2 Explosion 3 History 4 See also Neighbour bonus Reactors receive a bonus for adjacent operating reactors, which increases their effective thermal output by 100% per each such link. For example, two reactors operating next to each other will output a total of 160 MW of thermal energy, with each reactor producing 40 MW base and receiving 40 MW of neighbour bonus. The Neighbour bonus only applies if: 2 reactors are directly adjacent to each other with all 3 heat connections directly connecting the two. Both reactors are fueled. Double-row layout The most efficient practical layout is an aligned double row of arbitrary length (number of reactors as needed). For even numbers of reactors, the total output of the array is 160n − 160 MW (where n = total number of reactors, and assuming all are fueled). Splitting the row, while possibly logistically beneficial, reduces total power output by 160 MW per split. Odd numbers of reactors are inefficient in maximizing the bonus, but, if needed, the odd reactor should be aligned with one of the rows. Offsetting the longer row instead would not gain the extra reactor any bonus, while the reactor on the other end of the same row would lose its bonus as well. Placing the odd reactor between the ends of aligned rows would also lead to one fewer bonus, and also make the design un-tileable. In any case however, such concerns are unlikely to arise until one has a very large base, as the individual output of reactors is massive, particularly with neighbour bonuses. As an example, a 5×2 reactor grid would produce 1,440 MW (1.44 GW), the equivalent of 1,600 steam engines, or 24,000 solar panels. Square layout Theoretically, a perfectly square grid of reactors with no spaces between would provide maximum bonus, as it minimizes the number of reactors with unlinked sides. This setup produces 200n − 160×sqrt(n) MW (where sqrt(n) is the square root of the number of reactors). However, while the heat pipe links will allow energy flow from reactors within the square, with no room around inner reactors, there will be no way to insert and remove fuel cells except manually (heat pipes are traversable by the player), which makes this setup impractical. Furthermore, the gains compared to the double-row design are not large. After some calculation, one arrives at the expression for the ratio of the two (double-row design in denominator) as (1.25n − sqrt(n)) ÷ (n − 1) which evaluates to, for example, 1 for 4 reactors, 1.07 for 16 reactors, 1.16 for 100 reactors (considering only numbers that both an equal-length double row and a square can be built from), and so on. In the limit (infinite number of reactors), the ratio approaches 1.25 as the edge corrections become insignificant. Explosion If a reactor is destroyed (by damage) while it is above 900°C, it will explode just like an atomic bomb . This explosion has enough power to destroy other reactors, so one explosion can lead to a chain reaction of exploding reactors.

Currently, this is limited to heat exchangers , nuclear reactors , and heating towers . Heat pipes have a heat capacity of 1 MJ/°C. Thus, they can theoretically buffer 500 MJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, making them a space-efficient energy store. However, because temperature needs a drop of greater than 1 degree before it will \"flow,\" you can't raise them all the way to 1000°C or drain them all the way to 500°C, so the practical energy capacity will depend on the layout. As heat pipes rise in temperature, they will give off a very low-distance glow. On the planet Aquilo , heat pipes are a necessity due to the freezing temperatures. If buildings are not adjacent to heat pipes (or similar objects) with a temperature of at least 30°C, the building will freeze and stop working. Heat pipe throughput Each heat pipe holds an amount of heat energy, and there is a limit to how much energy can go through each of them for a given duration. For any heat pipe entity with one input connection on one side and one output connection on another, this entity will lower the temperature by 1 + (P / 15) °C with P being the power going through this entity expressed in MW. A heat exchanger must heat up to 500°C before it can generate steam. And the maximum temperature of a heat generator (such as a nuclear reactor) is 1000°C. As such, the temperature difference between a heat source and the heat exchanger is at most 500°C. We can thus express the maximum length of a straight line of heat pipe as 500 / (1 + P/15) . For example let's take a single nuclear reactor outputting 40MW of heat power to a single line of heat pipes. The furthest that line can go is 500 / (1 + 40/15) which is around 136 heat pipes long. A nuclear reactor can also be used to transfer heat in a similar manner as a heat pipe, whether or not it is fueled. In this case, the reactor will drop the temperature by 1 + (P / 387) °C , with P again being the power in MW going through the entity. Note that this is an approximation, the actual value measured is supposed to be 200000/517 or about 386.847. That being said, the nuclear reactor entity is also much bigger, meaning that we must compare it to 5 lines of 5 heat pipes instead of just a single one. The nuclear reactor will thus lower the temperature 5 times less with near-zero power going through it, and nearly 26 times less when approaching infinite power, compared to those lines of heat pipes. As an example, a single line of 100 nuclear reactors (or 500 tiles) will only lower the temperature by about 360°C while carrying 1GW. In Space Age , on Aquilo , heat pipes are used to prevent entities from freezing . They automatically transfer heat into neighboring entities. Different entities consume different amounts of heat to prevent freezing, but they do not have the temperature requirements of a heat exchanger. Heat pipes only need to be at least 30°C to keep an entity warm. Also, heat pipes do not lose heat to the environment; they only lose heat to entities that need to be kept warm.

Heat exchangers produce ~103 steam with a temperature of 500°C every second. Heat exchangers will not produce steam until they reach 500°C. The steam produced is exactly 500°C hot, even if the exchanger is hotter. Heat exchangers have a heat capacity of 1 MJ/°C. Thus, they can buffer 500 MJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, and require 485 MJ of energy to warm up from 15°C to 500°C when initially placed. Calculating steam production rate Heat exchangers produce 103 steam/second. This can be calculated by relying on steam turbine data: A steam turbine consumes 60 steam/second and produces 5.82MW (assuming 500°C steam). This means a single unit of 500°C steam has 5.82MW / (60/s) = 0.097 MJ of energy. A heat exchanger produces 10 MJ a second, therefore it produces 10MJ / 0.097MJ = 103.0927835 steam per second. The steam production rate can also be calculated using the energy consumption: 1 heat exchanger consumes 10MW, so it's putting 10MJ of energy into heating water/steam per second. To heat up 1 unit of steam 1 degree, 200 joules are needed, so the heat exchanger is heating up water by 50,000 unit-°C in total. We observe that this heating results in a temperature increase from 15°C to 500°C, so an increase of 485°C. So the 50,000 unit-°C is divided among 103 units of steam per second, since 50,000 / 485 = 103.09 . Since steam is produced from water in a 10:1 ratio, this also means that 10.3 units of water are consumed per second.

However, actual power production is based on the temperature of the steam, not the building itself. This means that using a steam turbine is no more fuel-efficient than using two steam engines. Unless saving space within a large build, it is not necessary to use the more costly turbines for boiler steam. Power output Each steam turbine takes a maximum input of 60 units of 500°C steam per second and outputs 5.82MW of electricity; the 5.8MW listed on the tooltip is rounded. Heat exchanger converts water to steam at a 1:10 ratio, and heats it from 15°C to 500°C; It takes 0.2 kJ of heat energy to raise 1 steam 1°C; Steam is consumed by steam turbines at a rate of 60 units per second; (500°C - 15°C) × 0.2 kJ × 60 units/s = 5820 kJ/s, or 5.82 MW. On the other hand, the calculation for the Boiler-generated steam is: (165°C - 15°C) × 0.2 kJ × 60 units/s = 1800 kJ/s, or 1.8 MW.

The fusion reactor generates plasma from fusion power cells , fluoroketone (cold) , and electricity. The plasma can be used in a fusion generator to generate power. Unlike the nuclear reactor , a fusion fuel cell usage scales with the plasma output, so no energy is lost. At full power draw, a single fusion power cell will be consumed in 400 seconds. A single reactor can output 100 MW worth of plasma. A reactor requires 10 MW of power to generate plasma. As such, starting a reactor setup requires some external power, but once plasma is in the generators, the reactor setup can power itself. Fluoroketone is not permanently consumed by a fusion reactor setup; it is used as a coolant. The coolant is (effectively) converted into an equal amount of plasma by the reactor, and the generator produces hot fluoroketone based on how much plasma the generator consumes, so any cold fluoroketone consumed by a reactor will be regenerated by the generator. To keep the loop going, a cryogenic plant must cool the hot fluoroketone back to cold before recirculating it into the reactor. Each reactor consumes at most 4 cold fluoroketone per second. Assuming no modules are used, 1 cryogenic plant can cool enough fluoroketone for one reactor. Contents 1 Achievements 2 Neighbour bonus 3 History 4 See also Achievements Fusion power Start producing electric power by fusion powerplant . Neighbour bonus Like nuclear reactors, fusion reactors receive a bonus for adjacent operating reactors, which increases the energy potential of the generated plasma by 100% per linked reactor. Fusion reactors differ in that the bonus only requires an adjacent reactor to share one fluid connection rather than three heat connections; connecting two outputs to the same reactor grants no additional benefit. Reactors have 2 fluid connections on each side, so the highest bonus a reactor can practically receive (while still leaving room to insert fusion power cells) is +500%. Unlike other power generators, the heat of the plasma generated is variable and is determined by the reactor's neighbour bonus. With no bonus, the plasma generated is at 1 million °C. With a 100% bonus, the plasma generated is at 2 million °C, and so on. Different reactors in an array can generate plasma at different temperatures, with the temperatures averaging out within the plasma fluid system. Fusion generators will generate power based on the heat of the plasma they are consuming, up to their maximum of 50 MW each. The amount of cold fluoroketone consumed by the reactor to generate power does not change with the neighbour bonus - it will always be 4/s (modified by quality). Two separate reactors will consume the same amount of cold fluoroketone per second at max power draw as two adjacent reactors with a neighbour bonus. Larger arrays of reactors and generators will require more fluoroketone to exist in the system, simply because there are more fluid pipes for the coolant and plasma to go through, but they do not require constantly adding more to the system.

The fusion generator consumes plasma from the fusion reactor to generate electric energy and fluoroketone (hot) . Fusion generators generate an amount of energy based on the temperature of the plasma feeding the generator. However, they can only extract so much energy from plasma over a particular amount of time. This is 50 MJ per second, producing 50 MW of power. This increases with quality . When plasma is consumed to generate electricity, an amount of hot fluoroketone is also generated equal to the amount of plasma consumed. If this fluid is not removed from the generator, it will be unable to generate power. Fluoroketone must be removed and taken to a cryogenic plant for cooling into fluoroketone (cold) (usually to be fed back into a fusion reactor). The fusion generator has nine fluid connection points: two plasma inputs, five plasma outputs for passing plasma to other generators, and two hot fluoroketone outputs. Because plasma cannot go into pipes, fusion generators will have to be placed in close proximity to fusion reactors. Each generator must also have space for outputting fluoroketone into pipes to be cooled. While generators are immune to freezing on Aquilo , the output pipes for hot fluoroketone can freeze. So on Aquilo, extra space must also be used around generators for heat pipes to heat the output pipes. History 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

It burns fuel to mine the ore underneath the 2×2 area it is placed on. It mines about 7 items per single unit of coal used to fuel it, producing 0.25 items/s for copper ore , coal , iron ore or stone . Burner miners create a lot of pollution per item. Burner drills are usually used until the player has built an electrical network , at which point the larger and faster electric mining drill becomes more useful, though they can still provide some use as extra drills that take up less space.

Method 1 Two burner mining drills can refuel each other when placed next to each other on a coal deposit as long as they're facing each other. Each drill fuels the other and coal gradually accumulates in their stacks , so you have effectively a storage of 100 coal (2 stacks, 50 coal, one in each burner miner, together 100). You can do this also for 4 or any other even number of miners. Note that it takes slightly less than 3 minutes for the mining drills to completely fill each other's fuel inventory. Once full, the drills will sit idle until the accumulated coal is removed. It's possible to extend that time by having the drills output their coal into a buffer chest rather than directly into another drill's fuel stack. Method 2 This method can be used for any number of burner mining drills in a coal deposit. Place a burner mining drill, then place at least three transport belts from the output in a mirrored \"L\" like shape so that the third belt has a gap between it and the miner. Fill the gap with a burner inserter in a way that the inserter can insert coal to the miner. When placing this array of entities opposite of each other, ensure that no two burner inserters are trying to take coal from the same piece of belt or one of them might run out of fuel.

This effect directly multiplies with the productivity of the drill in terms of the amount of resources that can be extracted from a single patch. The big mining drill is also able to mine harder ores such as tungsten that the lower tier mining drills cannot. Much like the electric mining drill, it is able to use fluids via pipe connection.

Each field can be covered by only one pumpjack at a fixed spot. The pumpjack will then output an amount of fluid equal to 10 multiplied by the field's yield per second. For example, a field with 538% yield will generate 54 fluid per second. Without speed modules , one pumpjack cycle takes one second to complete. Extracting fluid lowers the field's yield by 1% per 300 pumpjack cycles, to a minimum of 20% of the initial yield or 2 fluid per second, whichever is larger. They are limited to a maximum output of 1000 fluid per cycle, achieved by a field with more than 9999% yield. However, such a high yield is rare with standard map generator settings. Pumpjacks can only be placed on fluid resource field tiles. Furthermore, the output pipe location is fixed relative to the pumpjack's orientation. In the base game, the only kind of resource field yields crude oil . In Space Age , the pumpjack can also extract sulfuric acid from Vulcanus , as well as fluorine and lithium brine from Aquilo . Lithium brine resource fields are special; unlike the other resource fields, these can run out. These patches do not display a percentage; they instead report the total amount of fluid in the field. They also do not produce less fluid over time. A pumpjack will always produce the same amount of fluid per second on any lithium brine field until it is exhausted: 60 fluid per cycle. Contents 1 Tips 2 Gallery 3 History 4 See also Tips A resource field that has depleted (to the minimum of 20%) can still make use of speed modules , which are thus a good option for raising the pumpjack's output. With two speed module 3s , the output doubles from 2 to 4 fluid per second. With two legendary speed module 3s, the output increases by a factor of 3.5 from 2 to 7 fluid per second. The formula to determine the modified output is: Output of unmodified pumpjack x (1 + number of modules in pumpjack x average module bonus + transmission strength x number of modules in each beacon x average module bonus) Example: For a pumpjack on a depleted resource field with two level 3 speed modules and 4 beacons with each two level 3 speed modules: 2 x (1 + 2 x 0.5 + √4 x 1.5 x 2 x 0.5) = 10 fluid per second. Assuming that there will be always two speed 3 modules equipped in the pumpjack and beacons, the formula for 4 beacons can be shortened: 2 x (2 + √4 x 1.5) = 10 fluid per second. Additionally, on an infinite resource well (such as oil) and barring the use of beacons, the best modules to place in a pumpjack are speed modules . This does not depend on yield.\nAs an example: be two oil wells, W1 and W2, both with an initial yield of 1 000%. The first one is slotted with two normal quality productivity module 3s , the second one with two normal quality speed module 3s . Below is a table summing up the production of each well (amount produced per cycle is rounded up based on the first few lines of this page). Time (minutes) Produced (W1) Yield (W1) Produced (W2) Yield (W2) 0 0 1000 0 1000 1 5040 1000 12000 1000 8 40 320 999 96 000 997 72 362 830 990 855 480 972 715 3 440 959 900 7 392 240 714 2000 8 718 394 720 14 510 400 200 5715 17 422 423 200 23 426 400 200 How to read (e.g. line 3): after both wells have been active for 8 minutes, W1 has produced 40 320 units of oil and its yield has decreased to 999%; W2 has produced 96 000 units of oil and its yield has decreased to 997%. W2 has produced more oil than W1 at every point in time. When W1 finally depletes to the minimum 20% of its original yield, it produces (yield x (1+productivity) x speed) oil per second, so 20 x 1.2 x 0.7 = 16.8 oil per second, while W2 produces 20 x 1 x 2 = 40 oil per second, so W2 also produces more when the well is depleted. Speed modules are thus better from start to finish, even on a well with high initial yield. While there is a period when W1 produces more than W2 (because W2 depletes quicker), from ~1475 minutes to ~4428 minutes, W2 still has produced more in total than W1 at every point in this period. The closest they come is near minute 4428 (~74h), when W1 has produced 19 386 927 and W2 20 337 600. Then the gap increases again in favour of W2. Yet higher yields do not change this figure, and e.g. a 5 000 starting yield has W1 and W2 come closest around 369h of operation, with W2 still 5% ahead in terms of total produced. The difference is exacerbated by an increase in the quality of the modules: with legendary quality modules, the moment W1 depletes, it has produced 21 778 029 units of oil, while W2 has produced 33 713 400 (55% more). The difference in production from there onward is (W1) 20 x 1.5 x 0.7 = 21 to (W2) 20 x 1 x 3.5 = 70. In conclusion: to maximize production of oil and in the absence of beacons, pumpjacks should be equipped with speed modules . However, if at least two beacons are present that are slotted with tier 3 speed modules, some quick calculations seem to make tier 3 productivity modules best for the pumpjack, until mining productivity is researched, at which point speed is best.

Additionally, the foundry can also make other foundries (but only on Vulcanus), all belt types, and holmium plates ; the recipes are the same as used in assembling machines. Efficiency Most of the foundry's recipes are more efficient than creating the same items in a furnace or assembling machine . However, because of the built-in +50% productivity bonus (which applies even to items like belts that don't benefit from productivity modules ), and because the same bonus also applies to the recipes for molten iron and molten copper , the actual efficiency gains from using a foundry are much higher than the value listed in the recipe. The table below compares the values of the base recipes (with 1 ore = 10 molten metal), and then shows the actual output of the recipe with the default foundry bonuses of 4 crafting speed and 150% productivity (1 ore = 15 molten metal). For example, inserting 200 iron ore into a foundry with no modules installed would result in 3,000 molten iron which could be turned into 450 iron plates .

In this case, the inherent +50% productivity bonus of the foundry does not matter, nor do any productivity modules the foundry has, because those bonuses also apply when casting the metal plates. Instead, the decision is between any productivity bonus the second production machine can provide verses the fact that most of the 'Casting' recipes cost less to begin with. (This inherent advantage is the value listed in the 'Efficiency' column under 'Base recipe values' in the above table.) Steel plates Initially, it seems like the electric furnace, with just 2 module slots, cannot make up for the 67% inherent efficiency boost from the cast-steel recipe. However, steel production also has an infinite research which adds a productivity bonus; while this bonus applies to both casting steel and smelting steel (and doesn't apply to casting iron plates in order to smelt them into steel), the 50% inherent productivity and more module slots of the foundry give it a higher bonus to start with, meaning that the same absolute bonus makes for a larger relative increase in the electric furnace. (For example, with no productivity modules, researching 5 levels of the technology will take the foundry from 150% productivity to 200% productivity, boosting its output by a third, while the furnace will go from 100% productivity to 150% productivity, boosting its output by a half.) With the right combination of high-quality productivity module 3s and steel plate productivity research, it is possible to make the electric furnace production chain more efficient. For example, a foundry with 4 legendary productivity module 3s (+25% productivity each) casting iron plates feeding an electric furnace with 2 legendary productivity module 3s and a +50% steel plate productivity has exactly the same overall efficiency as a foundry with 4 legendary productivity module 3s and the same +50% steel plate productivity casting steel plates directly, with both producing exactly 1 steel plate per 10 units of molten iron. Any additional research past that point will make the electric furnace production chain strictly better. If using mere rare productivity module 3s (+16% productivity each) instead, the changeover happens somewhere between +150% and +160% research. Additionally, with enough levels of steel plate productivity research, it is possible to reach the hard cap of 400% efficiency. Thus the absolute maximum efficiency possible for casting steel is 4/3 steel plates per 10 units of molten iron, while the electric furnace production chain can reach 2 steel plates per 10 units of molten iron. Iron gear wheels It is never possible for gears made in an assembler to be more efficient than those made by casting them directly. The cast gears recipe is twice as efficient as the normal one and no productivity research applies; the highest efficiency possible from an assembler, 200% from an assembler 3 with 4 legendary productivity module 3s, is only just enough to break even. Iron sticks Conversely, the cast iron stick recipe has no inherent resource efficiency at all, thus casting iron plates and then converting them to sticks using an assembler with any productivity modules at all is more efficient than using that same foundry to cast them directly. Pipes & Pipes to ground Unlike all the other items with alternate production chains here, pipes and pipes to ground are not intermediate products. Thus it is not possible to use productivity modules on foundries or assemblers which are producing them. Since it is possible to use productivity modules on a foundry casting iron plates which are then converted to pipes in an assembler, doing so is more efficient than casting them directly. Copper cables Much like iron gears, copper cables have a 200% efficient casting recipe and no researchable productivity bonus, thus it is not possible to produce them more efficiently using an assembler. However, copper cables can also be produced in the electromagnetic plant , which has 5 module slots and an inherent +50% productivity boost of its own. So long as the electromagnetic plant's total productivity is greater than 100%, this production chain is more efficient than casting directly. 5 productivity 3s of common quality (+10% productivity each) will give a total productivity of exactly 100%; any better quality modules, or productivity 2s of epic quality or better, will make them more efficient. Low density structure Low density structures are notable because the crafting recipe has an efficiency of less than 100% with respect to copper, and while its efficiency with respect to iron is greater than 100%, it is less than the inherent efficiency of casting steel plates. Thus, even with no productivity modules or productivity research at all, casting the plates and then creating the low density structures in an assembler is more efficient. However, low density structures also require plastic, and since plastic bars cannot be cast, you are losing out on the inherent +50% productivity bonus the foundry offers: Process Raw resources to make 1 Furnaces + Assemblers 10 20 5 Foundry Direct 3.5 11.1 3.33 Foundries + Assemblers 2.67 8.88 5 Note that making low density structures is subject to its own productivity research , and both that, and the use of productivity modules of any kind, will make the use of the alternate production chain more attractive: the efficiency gain for iron and copper will increase, while the efficiency loss in plastic, while not entirely negated, will shrink. For example, with no efficiency boosts, the alternative production chain is 33% more efficient in iron, 25% more efficient in copper, and 33% less efficient in plastic, but with +100% productivity from research, the alternative production chain is 60% more efficient in iron, 50% more efficient in copper, and only 20% less efficient in plastic. Additionally, the hard cap of 300% productivity applies here, too, and this can entirely negate the penalty to plastic, though the level of research required to do do is considerable. The low density structure casting recipe does have one advantage: Quality . Because the only solid input is plastic, all it takes to make low density structures of a particular quality is to have plastic of that quality. Furthermore, since low density structures can be recycled back to copper and steel plates, one can use this recipe to generate high quality copper and steel plates from plastic, consuming less molten metal than many other means of producing quality plates. Additionally, if the foundry can get to the 300% low density structures productivity cap (via modules and research), then the plastic will (on average) be completely regenerated, allowing a small amount of quality plastic to produce arbitrary amounts of quality copper and steel plates, given sufficient molten metal.

The recycler is a building that can convert most items into the ingredients used in their recipes, at the cost of losing 75% of said ingredients. In other words, it performs a lossy reversal of crafting. Although it can only be crafted on Fulgora, it can be transported to be placed on other planets or space platforms . It has 4 module slots, but it cannot use productivity modules . Contents 1 Mechanics 1.1 Non-recyclable items 1.2 Unique recycling recipes 1.3 Stats 1.4 Technical details 2 Trivia 3 Gallery 4 History 5 See also Mechanics When an item enters a recycler, the item's main recipe is found, and the recycler is automatically set to perform its inverse. For each type of item used as an ingredient in the recycled item's main recipe, the number of items returned by the recycler is decided by ⌊ 0 . 2 5 ⋅ i o + r ⌋ , where i is the number of items used as ingredients, o is the number of items returned by the recipe, and r is a random number that is greater than or equal to 0 but less than 1. On average, this returns exactly 25% of the items needed to craft one item of the same type as the recycled item. For example, recycling a processing unit always gives 5 electronic circuits while having a 50% chance of returning one advanced circuit . All fluid ingredients are lost when recycling, as the recycler has no fluid output. Without quality modules, the resulting items have the same quality as the item being recycled, even if the latter was crafted using lower-quality ingredients. Quality modules can further increase the output's quality, just like with regular non-recycling recipes. The recycler has 12 internal slots for its output, but can only hold one stack of each item. The recycler will try to eject the contents of these slots, much like a mining drill. It is therefore not necessary to use an inserter to collect its output. Much like the big mining drill , if the recycler has more than one of an individual item type in its inventory, the recycler will output stacks of materials onto a belt if the stack inserter has been researched. Non-recyclable items The broad rule governing the recycler's ability to reverse a recipe is that it can only reverse recipes made in assembling machines of some type. There are many exceptions to this, however. For the purposes of the recycler's ability to recycle items, the electromagnetic plant counts as an \"assembler\". So all of its recipes count unless otherwise stated. Recipes shared by assemblers and other machines are not so clear-cut: sometimes they count as recipes for those other machines, but sometimes they count as pure assembler recipes. Items can have multiple recipes; all that is needed for the recycler to reverse it is to find a single reversible recipe that produces that item. If no valid recipe producing the item can be reversed, the recycler will return the same item 25% of the time (possibly with a quality bonus if the appropriate modules are used), with the other 75% destroying the item. The in-game description says \"Other items are ... turned to spoilage if they were biological.\" Despite this, only nutrients are turned to spoilage. Most other apparently biological items, such as jelly , eggs, or biolabs , get returned 25% of the time, as listed (or not listed, since eggs cannot be created in assemblers) in the table below.

This is used to obtain most resources on Fulgora . Recycling nutrients will yield 2.5× that amount of spoilage , as if they were made using the nutrients from spoilage recipe. Stats The recycling recipe for an item, other than scrap, is equal to 1/16th (0.0625) of the time it takes to craft that item. (Items without recipes, such as ore, are treated as having a crafting time of 0.5 seconds.) However, because the recycler has a base crafting speed of 0.5, the time it takes one recycler to recycle one item without modules or beacons is effectively 1/8th (0.125) of the item's crafting time. For example, the time it takes to craft a steel plate in a stone furnace (which has a crafting speed of 1) is 16 seconds, and so recycling a steel plate takes 2 seconds. Some items with long crafting times (most notably steel plates and concrete ) can be processed much more quickly by crafting them into other items and then recycling the result instead. The following table provides some examples of how long it takes a recycler without modules or beacons to recycle one of that item, and the rate at which it recycles those items. Recycler input Time Rate Steel plate 2.0s 0.5/s Low density structure 1.875s 0.533/s Processing unit 1.25s 0.8/s Concrete 1.25s 0.8/s Advanced circuit 0.75s 1.33/s Copper plate 0.4s 2.5/s Steel chest 0.0625s 16/s Iron ore 0.0625s 16/s Hazard concrete 0.03125s 32/s The scrap recycling recipe takes 0.2 seconds, meaning that it actually takes 0.4 seconds to run in a recycler, so a recycler takes in 2.5 scrap/s. The output rates are as follows: Input Output Chance Rate Scrap Iron gear wheel 20% 0.5/s Solid fuel 7% 0.175/s Concrete 6% 0.15/s Ice 5% 0.125/s Steel plate 4% 0.1/s Battery 4% 0.1/s Stone 4% 0.1/s Copper cable 3% 0.075/s Advanced circuit 3% 0.075/s Processing unit 2% 0.05/s Low density structure 1% 0.025/s Holmium ore 1% 0.025/s In total, the recycler spits out 1.5 items/s, meaning 10 recyclers are just enough to saturate a yellow belt. The output values are increased by scrap recycling productivity research . Technical details Internally, the recycler uses the furnace prototype , which performs recipes that are automatically selected based on input ingredients. Every item in the game has its own \"recycling\" recipe, those recipes can only be performed by a recycler. Since there are hundreds of items in the game, as well as to ensure compatibility with third-party mods, most recycling recipes are not explicitly defined. Instead, recycling recipes are procedurally generated based on existing recipes. Depending on whether or not the item is deemed \"recyclable\", these procedurally generated recipes will either output a quarter of an item's ingredients or have a 25% chance of outputting the item itself. The recyclabillity of most items is based on the category of their recipes, with some exceptions being explicitly filtered by the name of the recipe's prototype. Furthermore, items with multiple viable recycling recipes are made non-recyclable to avoid ambiguity, and recipes with multiple different products will fail to generate a recycling recipe, thereby making them irreversible as a default. Third-party mods can also explicitly make a recipe irreversible by setting the recipe's auto_recycle field to false . The scrap recycling recipe is a special case, as it is the only hard-coded recipe. It is also the only recycling recipe that is not hidden from the player, and which can be performed without a recycler. (Notably, this recipe is defined by the Space Age mod rather than the Quality mod, as scrap is exclusive to the former.) The generation of recycling recipes, as well as the filtering of non-recyclable recipes, is defined by the file recycling.lua in the Quality mod's prototype folder. More specifically, the function default_can_recycle decides whether a given recipe can be recycled or not, and the function add_recipe_values does most of the configuration of recycling recipes, which includes setting the products of these recipes and how long they take to perform. Trivia If the recycled item has a fluid ingredient, then the smoke emitted from the recycler matches the fluid in colour. Gallery History 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

You can help this wiki by expanding it . Space Age expansion exclusive feature. The agricultural tower is a machine unlocked on Gleba . It automatically harvests and re-plants trees in its range, provided that it is supplied with seeds obtained via fruit processing, and the soils near it support the kinds of seeds it is loaded with. The agricultural tower can plant yumako seeds , jellynut seeds , or tree seeds . The agricultural tower's working area is broken up into 3×3 tile sectors - if one of these sectors is completely filled with a viable soil type, and the agricultural tower has a matching seed in its inventory ( artificial yumako soil or overgrowth yumako soil for yumako seeds, and artificial jellynut soil or overgrowth jellynut soil for jellynut seeds), then it will automatically plant the seed in that area. Hovering the cursor over an agricultural tower reveals its range, broken up into the 3×3 sectors; each sector will be color coded, with a green sector representing farmable land, a yellow sector representing areas that could have the farmable landfills placed there, and a red sector representing an area that cannot be farmed. The yellow indicator does not make a distinction between overgrowth and regular soil, so it is possible that a tile may appear to be farmable before the player can actually farm it. Note that a red area may have some farmable areas within it, the colour of the 3x3 sector is decided as a whole. Example of an agricultural tower, showing the various indicators. The agricultural tower will plant seeds and wait to harvest them until they have reached maturity. For yumako trees and jellystem trees, this is 5 minutes. For Nauvis trees planted with tree seeds, this takes 10 minutes. Tips Unlike most other methods of resource gathering in the game, agricultural towers do not benefit from mining productivity research , and they have no module slots. Each processed fruit has a 2% chance to return its respective seed, so the expected number of seeds that each tree produces is one - the same number of seeds that was used to produce the tree. Initially, this may restrict efforts to grow plantations, especially if fruits are allowed to spoil before being processed, which can actually result in the effective stock of trees and seeds diminishing. However, fruit processing does benefit from productivity - either via productivity modules or via the 50% inbuilt productivity of the biochamber . Using just a biochamber with no extra productivity modules takes the expected seeds each tree returns from 1 to 1.5. Note that this is only an expectation - there is no underlying mechanic that guarantee 50 fruits will return any number of seeds. It is entirely possible that one might process all 50 fruits harvested from a single tree, or even multiple trees, and obtain no seeds in return. Agricultural towers may be activated or deactivated via the circuit network . This can be useful to avoid letting excess fruit back up, as they may eventually spoil and be wasted - and even if it does not, the extra time spent waiting to be processed decreases the freshness of the item, which in turn may decrease the freshness of recipes that consume this item. It's worth mentioning that agricultural towers will collect fruit until their inventory is full, even if inserters aren't removing the fruits, and therefore it's inadvisable to control fruit production via inserters, lest the fruit turn into spoilage while still inside the agricultural tower.

The Biochamber is a biological variant of the assembling machine and chemical plant , unlocked on Gleba . Unlike most other production buildings, it does not require electricity, but rather a steady supply of nutrients to operate. It has a built-in 50% productivity bonus. One unit of nutrients will power a biochamber for 4 seconds. The powered duration per nutrient can be increased by using efficiency modules , or reduced by modules that increase energy consumption. An inactive biochamber uses no energy, but any nutrients contained in its fuel slot continue to spoil . As such, an inactive biochamber will still have nutrients inserted into them if they are available. The biochamber, like any machine, will not function if there are too many items in its trash slots (usually generated from an input or output spoiling). Unfiltered output inserters will remove items from trash slots. The biochamber is technically classified as a burner device , and its fuel slot can be filtered ( Middle mouse button by default) to only accept a specific quality of nutrients. This can be used to prevent high-quality nutrients from being consumed as fuel. Biochambers have the unique property of having negative pollution . This means that, if a biochamber is built on Nauvis , it will absorb pollution. Furthermore, modules that affect pollution (by increasing energy consumption or directly) will make the negative value larger. So heavy use of biochambers with productivity modules and speed modules in beacons can lead to substantial pollution absorption. Recipes The biochamber has a large number of recipes, many of which are exclusive to the biochamber or to Gleba or both.

A captive biter spawner is a special production building that is initially unlocked by researching Captivity (research) with agricultural science packs and is used to produce biter eggs . A captive biter spawner has no module slots, is unaffected by beacons , and cannot be connected to either circuit or logistic networks. A captive spawner cannot be removed by the player or construction robots , but can be destroyed via weapon fire, at which point it will spawn a small biter. Contents 1 Biter egg production 2 Obtainment 3 Food consumption 4 Quality 5 Gallery 6 History 7 See also Biter egg production Captive biter spawners are solely used to produce biter eggs , for which they are the only source in the game. Producing biter eggs does not require setting a recipe or providing any ingredients other than a constant influx of fuel in the form of bioflux . A captive biter spawner can hold a maximum of 100 biter eggs, which they produce at a rate of 5 eggs every 10 seconds, or 0.5 /s. The production cycle continues when the output slot is full, even though no additional eggs are being produced. Biter eggs held in the output slot will not start to spoil until removed. Obtainment Initially, the only way to create a captive biter spawner is by firing a capture bot rocket at a biter spawner on Nauvis , which will slowly transform the spawner into a captive one. After reaching Aquilo and researching Captive biter spawner (research) , the player can craft captive biter spawners themselves, which can be manually placed. While in the player's inventory or another container, a captive spawner has a spoilage time of 30 minutes, at which point it will turn into a behemoth biter. Food consumption A captive spawner requires a constant supply of bioflux . Starving spawners will stop producing biter eggs and lose health at a rate of 1/second. If a captive spawner's health reaches zero, it will transform back into a normal spawner and will have to be captured again. Previously captured and then starved biter spawners are normally not targeted by automated weapon systems, including turrets , artillery , and spidertron 's automatic rocket launchers, but they will still be targeted by Capture bot rockets . They still consume pollution and spawn biters which are affected by the evolution factor . Bioflux is used for food. One item of bioflux has an energy value of 6 MJ, and since the captive biter spawner consumes 100 kW of food, each item of bioflux will last for exactly one minute. With one normal quality item of bioflux lasting for two hours before it spoils , this means that 120 items of bioflux of the same age may be consumed by a single captive biter spawner before any of them spoil. Quality Captive biter spawners with a higher quality level will not yield higher quality biter eggs . If a captive biter spawner reverts back into a biter spawner for any reason, it will retain the quality it had as a captive biter spawner. This resulting spawner will spawn biters of the same quality, which will have the capability of forming expansion groups that will also retain their quality level upon successful expansion - creating more quality biter or spitter spawners, and even quality worms . Failing to contain such reverted spawners can lead to the planet becoming populated by higher quality enemies. Gallery A previously captured spawner.

Labs are buildings that perform research for technologies by consuming science packs . Use of a lab is required to progress in Factorio. When productivity modules are used in labs, the productivity bonus is directly calculated and applied each tick so the productivity bar is simply cosmetic. This means that it does not matter that the productivity bar resets when the research is changed, no productivity bonus is lost. [1] The player can only research one technology at a time, but can use multiple labs for faster results. The speed bonus of labs when lab research speed is researched and modules are present can be calculated using this formula: research_bonus × module_bonus = speed_bonus ; the percentage bonuses have to be converted to decimals (e.g. +140% = 2.4) before the formula is used. Inserters can insert and remove science packs from labs. This allows chaining multiple labs together with inserters, each inserter taking science packs, as needed, from one lab and placing it into the next. Contents 1 Production requirements 1.1 Equation simplification 2 History 3 See also Production requirements Calculating the number of science packs needed per second is straightforward: E R S = ( 1 + B [ r ] 1 0 0 ) × ( 1 + M [ r ] 1 0 0 ) × B L S A C T = T [ r ] E R S P P S = N A C T Where: ERS is \"effective lab research speed\" B[r] is the speed bonus from the Lab research speed (research) , in percent M[r] is the sum of all module speed effects ( speed modules - positive; productivity modules - negative), in percent BLS is the base lab speed, which is adjusted by the quality of the lab and/or using a biolab ACT is \"adjusted cycle time\" T[r] is the research cycle time as displayed in the research screen PPS is \"packs per second\" N is the number of labs available. Thus, with 10 base quality standard labs, researching Nuclear Power (30 second cycle time) with Lab Research Speed 4 (140% bonus) and no module effects, the calculation is: E R S = 1 + 1 4 0 1 0 0 = 2 . 4 A C T = 3 0 2 . 4 = 1 2 . 5 s P P S = 1 0 1 2 . 5 = 0 . 8 This means 0.8 science packs per second, of each type, would need to be produced to continuously supply the labs. Equation simplification Assuming all labs have the same B[r] and BLS ), the above calculations can be combined into one equation: P P S = N T [ r ] × ( 1 + B [ r ] 1 0 0 ) × ( 1 + M [ r ] 1 0 0 ) × B L S Thus for the numerical example: P P S = 1 0 × ( 1 + 1 4 0 1 0 0 ) × 1 3 0 = 1 0 3 0 × ( 1 + 1 . 4 ) = 1 3 × 2 . 4 = 2 . 4 3 = 0 . 8 packs per second If trying to find the amount of labs needed to consume a given amount of packs per second, use the following rearrangement: N = [ ( 1 + B [ r ] 1 0 0 ) × ( 1 + M [ r ] 1 0 0 ) × B L S × 1 T [ r ] × P P S ] − 1 History 0.15.12 : Lab speed info in the description contains the researched speed bonus as well. 0.12.6 : The research speed of a lab is now not dependent on its electricity consumption, and can be scripted. 0.12.0 : Lab research is now continuous; Science packs now have progress bars. 0.9.2 : Labs are now named after early access backers when built from blueprints . 0.7.2 : Changed the recipe of Lab to require 4 transport belts, down from 5. 0.7.0 : Added support for modules to labs. 0.6.0 : New graphics.

The Biolab is an upgraded version of the lab that is unlocked by researching the Biolab technology using Agricultural science pack from Gleba . It boasts a number of advantages over the standard lab: Biolabs have a built-in speed bonus, meaning research is processed twice as quickly (effectively a 100% speed bonus) Biolabs have 50% science drain, meaning they consume half as many packs for the same amount of research progress Put together, the above two points effectively mean the biolab consumes science packs at the same rate as the regular lab, but gives double the research progress. This is like a productivity bonus, except it stacks multiplicatively rather than additively with other bonuses. Biolabs have four module slots instead of two. Biolabs are larger (5x5) and have more health. It features minimal disadvantages: They are more complicated to create, involving Biter eggs which require Bioflux to acquire. They may only built on Nauvis . They use more power and pollute more. The speed bonus granted from lab research speed multiplies with the Biolab's increased speed.

The heating tower burns fuel to generate heat. Initially unlocked on Gleba , it is useful for burning off unneeded biological products as well as providing electrical power. It later becomes a vital source of heat against the cold of Aquilo . The heating tower has 250% efficiency, so it generates 2.5 times the fuel value in heat of any fuel given to it. The internal heat of heating towers is limited to 1000°C. Like a nuclear reactor, heating towers will continue to burn fuel even if they have reached their maximum heat. The fact that they burn fuel regardless of temperature makes them more useful than a boiler for destroying unneeded biological materials. Also like a reactor, you can read their heat and fuel status through the circuit network . The heating tower has a heat capacity of 5 MJ/°C. Thus, they can buffer 2.5GJ of heat energy across their working range of 500°C to 1000°C, and they require 2.43 GJ of energy to warm up from 15°C to 500°C when initially placed. Because of the efficiency however, this means they only need 0.97 GJ of fuel to reach 500°C, which is slightly less than 10 rocket fuel . More fuel will be needed to bring the connected heat pipes and heat exchangers up to temperature. Note that heating towers produce less pollution per unit energy produced than boilers. Boilers produce 3.6 MJ per pollution generated, while heating towers produce 24 MJ per pollution. This coupled with their efficiency makes them a more efficient and clean alternative to boilers on Nauvis . History 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

A beacon is a device that transmits module effects to nearby non-burner machines, in a 9×9 square, while also boosting the effects of said modules. A beacon allows transmitting the effect of a module to multiple machines, and multiple beacons can affect the same machine, albeit with diminishing returns. Additionally, beacons can provide boosts beyond the normal limits of internal module slots. The beacon emanates an electrical charge at a steady interval, the color changes depending on which modules are placed into the beacon, or if it contains none at all. Contents 1 Usage 2 Limitations 3 Transmission strength 4 Maximum number per building 5 Beacon arrays 5.1 Multi-row arrays 5.2 Optimal arrays 6 History 7 See also Usage Beacons are best in these scenarios: There are many compatible machines in a dense area This allows the beacon's effect to reach multiple machines, allowing the player to save materials from crafting modules. There is one machine that must have an extreme speed of operation Mining drills present an example of this usefulness. When an ore patch is small but rich, more speed per drill is necessary to meet demand, since adding more drills isn't possible. So, multiple speed module beacons around a mining drill (with modules in the drill itself) can be used to increase the speed of the individual drill several times, to make up for the low quantity of drills. Beacons should not be used in these scenarios: The machine(s) being boosted operate infrequently This leads to power waste as beacons will always consume power, even when the machines they're boosting are halted. This however can be circumvented with some planning, and using a power switch . Attempting to boost non-module-compatible machines Only machines that have module slots will be affected by a beacon. Limitations Only buildings with module slots can benefit from beacon effects (i.e. laser turret doesn't benefit). The only exceptions to this rule are beacons themselves which don't benefit from the modules inserted in themselves (or other beacons), so their energy cost can't be reduced. Currently, only speed and efficiency modules can be used in beacons, and productivity and quality modules cannot. Multiple beacons overlapping the same machine will have diminishing returns, so it's more efficient to surround buildings around beacons than surround beacons around buildings. Transmission strength The effect of modules placed in beacons is not equal to those placed in the machines themselves. Rather, it is multiplied by a factor called \"transmission strength\". This factor is applied to all stats affected by the module, both good and bad. The transmission strength itself depends on two factors. One is the distribution efficiency stat of the beacon; For normal beacons, this is always 1.5, but quality can increase it up to 2.5 for legendary beacons. The second factor is the reciprocal square root of the number of beacons affecting each machine. Therefore, in total, n normal quality beacons affecting the same machine will have a combined transmission strength of 1.5 x n^0.5 . In practical terms, this means that there are diminishing returns on increasing the number of beacons affecting the same machine, as the effect per beacon decreases when more are added. Maximum number per building The maximum number of beacons that can be built in range of a building depend on that building's footprint: Buildings from 2×2 to 4×4 size: 12 beacons , with an effect of 3.46 times that of a single beacon. Buildings from 5×5 to 7x7 size: 16 beacons , with an effect of 4 times that of a single beacon. Buildings from 8x8 to 10x10 size: 20 beacons , with an effect of 4.47 times that of a single beacon. It should be noted that, because the space between a beacon and a machine can not be greater than two tiles without putting the machine outside of the beacon's range, belt routing can become a challenge. In some situations, use of the logistic network may be required in order to supply the machines. The maximum number of beacons that can be built in range of a row of buildings: Row of 3×3 buidings: 8 beacons , with an effect of 2.83 times that of a single beacon. Row of 5×5 buidings: 10 beacons , with an effect of 3.16 times that of a single beacon. Note that when buildings and beacons are arranged in parallel rows like this, the offset between buildings and beacons along the direction of the rows is important. For example, imagine placing a row of assembling machine 3s between two rows of beacons. If the sides of the beacons and the assembling machines line up, every assembling machine is affected by six beacons in total. Howevever, if either the beacons or the assembling machines are shifted by one tile relative to the other, then each assembling machine is affected by eight beacons in total. In general, depending on the width of the machines modulo 3: If the width of the machines is divisible by three, then the arrangement is optimal when the sides of a machine do not align with the sides of a beacon on the axis perpendicular to the direction of the rows. If the width of the machines modulo 3 is 1 (such as a width of 4), then any offset leads to an optimal layout. If the width of the machines modulo 3 is 2 (such as a width of 5), then the arrangement is optimal when the center of a machine aligns with the center of a beacon on the axis perpendicular to the direction of the rows. Note that this requires a one-tile gap between the machines. Beacon arrays Beacons can boost the overall capabilities of a factory quite significantly. However, they consume a considerable amount of power (480 kW apiece), take up nontrivial space, complicate logistics, and also are relatively expensive to craft. Therefore, when building an entire production line with a high beacon boost, it is significantly more economical to build a row of production buildings surrounded by row(s) of beacons, rather than single buildings surrounded by the maximum number of beacons theoretically possible. This also simplifies logistics and makes the design more tiling-friendly. The maximum possible benefits are reduced somewhat in row-array configuration (for 3×3 buildings, 8 beacons per building are possible instead of 12; for 5×5 buildings, 10 instead of 16), but the number of beacons required to achieve this boost level is considerably lower. For example, for a single row of 3×3 buildings surrounded by a double row of beacons so that each production building is in range of 8 beacons, the total number of beacons required is 2n + 6 , where n is the number of production buildings. The average number of beacons per building is then 2 + (6 ÷ n) , which tends toward 2 (i.e., a 75% reduction in the number of beacons needed compared to isolated buildings with 8 distinct beacons each) when n goes to infinity. For e.g. n = 10 the formula evaluates to 2.6, which is still a reduction of 67.5% in beacons needed. Multi-row arrays For large numbers of buildings to be boosted, efficiency can be further improved by separating production buildings into multiple rows. In this case, the beacons in all but the edge rows of the array can be shared by the two rows of production buildings on either side. (Note that it does not matter if these are producing different recipes and / or are different buildings altogether.) The total number of beacons required, assuming 3×3 sized production buildings and rows of equal length, is B(r,c) = (r + 1)(c + 3) = rc + 3r + c + 3 , where r is the number of rows of production buildings and c is the number of production buildings in a single row. The number of beacons per boosted building is then (3 ÷ rc) + (1 ÷ r) + (3 ÷ c) + 1 , which tends to 1 as both r and c go to infinity. For finite arrays, the optimum number of rows is given by r = -0.5 + sqrt[(n ÷ 3) + 0.25] , where n is the total number of buildings to be boosted. The formula above does not generally return integer results. If the r thus found is non-integer, iterate around it, i.e., calculate the number of beacons needed with floor(r) (the next lower integer) and ceiling(r) (the next higher integer) rows and compare the results. For each such integer r , calculate c as floor(n ÷ r) , then calculate the number of beacons as B(r,c) + mod(n,r) + 1, where B(r,c) is given above and mod(n,r) is n modulo r , i.e., the remainder of ( n ÷ r ), equal to n - ( r × c ). There will in either case be mod(n,r) buildings \"left over\"; these should be appended one per row to the ends of a contiguous block of neighboring rows for the total beacon count calculation above to be valid. Other configurations for the leftovers (e.g. all appended to the end of a single row, one each at the end of every second row, etc.) require a higher number of beacons to cover. Optimal arrays For 3×3 structures, arrays satisfying c = 3r are optimal, in the sense that they minimize the number of beacons required to cover the total number of structures ( rc ), therefore allowing the most use out of an individual beacon. Since structures may only be built in integer amounts, there are, below a reasonable cutoff on total array size, only a finite number of integer structure counts rc with which an optimal array such that c = 3r and c and r are integer may be built. The first few counts, along with associated array sizes and beacons-to-structures ratios, are summarized in the table below. Structures Rows Columns Beacons Beacons per structure Dimensions (tiles)* 3 1 3 12 4.00 18×11 12 2 6 27 2.25 27×19 27 3 9 48 1.78 36×27 48 4 12 75 1.56 45×35 75 5 15 108 1.44 54×43 108 6 18 147 1.36 63×51 147 7 21 192 1.31 72×59 ... ... ... ... ... ... 3r^2 r 3r (r + 1) (3r + 3) 1 + 2/r + 1/r^2 (9r + 9) × (8r + 3) Notes to table: Array dimension in tiles (last table column) assumes 2 tiles' space (e.g. inserter + chest) is left either above or below each row of structures, while no extra space is left anywhere else. The 5-row array (75 structures) is the largest that can be covered by a logistic network generated from roboports located outside its footprint. For larger arrays, at least a minimal number of roboports would need to be strategically placed in the interior to provide coverage, thereby worsening the beacons-to-structures proportion somewhat.

In Space Age , water can also be produced by a chemical plant by condensing steam or melting ice . After being pumped or produced it is distributed via pipes . Water can be used to generate electricity by converting it to steam via boilers or heat exchangers . The specific heat capacity of water is 2kJ / Δ°C / unit . However, one unit of water converts to ten units of steam, which has a heat capacity of 200J / Δ°C / unit . That is, it takes 200 joules to heat one unit of steam by one degree Celsius. Water is also used as an ingredient in various recipes. Surface water acts as an obstacle that cannot normally be traveled over. A spidertron can reach across water if another bit of land is sufficiently close, and wearing mech armor allows the player to fly over water. Raw fish are spawned in water tiles during world generation only, and do not reproduce naturally. Water tiles can be removed completely by placing landfill over them. Pollution will turn nearby water green, which is a visual-only effect (the effect can be turned off by disabling animated water in the graphics settings). The color changes relative to the current amount of pollution around it, so decreasing pollution purifies the water. Contents 1 Shallow water 2 Alternative recipes 3 Gallery 4 History 5 See also Shallow water Shallow water can appear alongside (or in place of) normal water. Shallow water can be walked on, but buildings can't be built in it directly. Shallow water can still have landfill placed upon it. Shallow water will reduce the speed of the player as well as wheeled vehicles . The speed reduction does not affect enemies or the spidertron . Offshore pumps can be used where shallow water meets land (including landfill). Shallow water appears as one of two shades of blue lighter than that of standard water, with the mildly lighter blue and moderately lighter blue reducing the player's walking speed by 30% or 20% respectively. In the base game, shallow water is not generated by the default map generator , so it can only be found in the tutorial . In Space Age , Gleba is the only planet with naturally generated shallow water, and it is found there in abundance. Alternative recipes Space Age expansion exclusive feature.

    "title": "Steam",
    "content": "Steam Edit Base game Space Age mod Prototype type fluid Internal name steam Produced by Consumed by Prototype type fluid Internal name steam Produced by Consumed by Steam is a gas created by heating water in a boiler or heat exchanger , or through acid neutralisation . After being distributed via pipes , steam can be used to generate electricity via steam engines and steam turbines . Steam is also used in coal liquefaction in oil refineries . Since steam is a fluid, it can be stored in a storage tank . Contents 1 Power generation 2 Trivia 3 History 4 See also Power generation The amount of energy contained in steam is linearly proportional to its temperature (minus 15°C ambient temperature). The energy storage of steam is exactly 200 joule / unit / degree Celsius , so every degree increase in temperature of a single unit of fluid requires exactly 200 joules. In all cases, steam produced in boilers is 165°C and steam from heat exchangers or acid neutralisation is 500°C. Higher temperature steam equates to a higher energy density of the same number of units of steam. Steam suffers no thermal losses sitting or flowing through pipes or storage tanks ; the energy put into water to create steam is the same amount of energy you get back out from it since both steam engines and turbines are 100% efficient. For example, a storage tank that holds 25000 units of Steam at 165°C contains: (200 J / unit / °C) * 25000 units * (165°C − 15°C) = 750 000 000 joules = 750 MJ A storage tank holding 25000 units of Steam at 500°C thus contains 2.425 giga joules of energy, a surprisingly large amount equal to 485 fully charged accumulators ! (200 J / unit / °C) * 25000 units * (500°C − 15°C) = 2 425 000 000 joules = 2.425 GJ If the temperature of the steam is lower than the steam engine or steam turbine can handle, then the power output will be lower than optimal, but no energy will be wasted. However, if the temperature of the steam exceeds the maximum temperature of the steam engine or turbine, then the power output is capped at maximum, and the extra energy in the steam is wasted. Other than this difference, either steam engines or turbines can be used to generate power off of steam from any source. Trivia The fill meter on steam storage tanks fills from the top instead of from the bottom. Steam is the only pre- Space Age fluid that cannot be stored in barrels . Assuming perfect efficiency of boilers and heat exchangers, the thermal energy content of steam implies that one unit represents 47.9g of water, meaning a full tank contains 1195 kg of steam. Because burner devices are not permitted on space platforms , and acid neutralization is Vulcanus -exclusive, the only way to get steam on platforms (either for power or liquefaction) is with heat exchangers powered by nuclear reactors 500°C steam in a pipe will still freeze on Aquilo . History 2.0.7 : Changed the water:steam ratio from 1:1 to 1:10 in all boilers/heat exchangers. 0.15.10 : Introduced as separate fluid. Previously it counted as Water, with a >100 temperature.

It can be transported either in pipes , barrels or fluid wagons . Crude oil is also found on Aquilo . It can also be used as ammo in flamethrower turrets . Oil fields Oil fields can be used indefinitely, but the amount they yield will reduce over time. Each oil field has a yield displayed as x%. Each percent is equal to 300 pumpjack cycles. Without speed modules one pumpjack cycle takes one second to complete. An oil field with 80% has between 24000 and 24299 cycles left, as yield does not display decimal places. While cycles left is greater than 6000 (20% yield) and greater than 20% of the initially available cycles, each pumpjack cycle reduces the number of cycles left by one. So unless an oil field with less than 20% yield is created by map editor, yield will never drop below 6000 cycles. The amount of oil a pumpjack extracts per cycle is yield multiplied by 10 (e.g. 115% yield = 1.15, multiplied by 10 = 11.5), and cannot be higher than 1000.

Recipes which use fluoroketone as a coolant will generate half as much hot fluoroketone as they consume. Cold fluoroketone is also used by fusion reactors .

It can be smelted into copper plates in a furnace . Copper ore is the main source of copper plates, which are one of the two principal raw materials (along with iron plates , made from iron ore ) for crafting the vast majority of items in the game. In the early game, copper is needed in smaller quantities than iron, with some early-game products not requiring it at all. Demand for copper increases considerably in the mid- and late-game, where it (mostly in the form of copper cables ) is required mainly for the assembly of electronic circuits and the myriad products those are required in, and for low density structures . The size, density, and richness of copper patches can, as for all other resources, be adjusted upon map generation at the start of a new game. Like all resource patches, copper patches increase in richness with increasing distance from the starting area. Volcanic rock from Vulcanus provides starting copper before crafting foundries which can directly produce copper plates. Alternative gathering In the Space Age expansion, each surface has its own way of obtaining copper ore. On Nauvis , it appears in patches that can be mined with drills, as in the base game. On space platforms , metallic asteroid chunks gathered with asteroid collectors can be processed into copper ore in crushers with the advanced metallic asteroid crushing recipe. On Gleba , copper ore can be obtained by allowing copper bacteria to spoil , which can be obtained sustainably in biochambers first from yumako mash and then by cultivating them with bioflux . On Vulcanus , copper ore can be found in rocks on the planet's surface. Most copper products, including low density structures, are produced in foundries from molten copper extracted from inexhaustible lava with calcite . Copper ore is not available on Fulgora , but copper plates can be obtained by recycling low density structure , copper cable and batteries , each of which can be obtained from recycling scrap . Demand is low since the highest volume items that require copper (low density structures, cables and circuits) can be obtained from scrap.

Instead of being smelted in a furnace , uranium ore must be processed in a centrifuge to produce uranium-235 and uranium-238 , which is used to craft fuel for the nuclear reactor and in various types of ammunition . Uranium ore is different from the other ores, as it requires sulfuric acid to be fed into the electric mining drill to mine it, at a rate of 10 sulfuric acid per 10 ore mined. Because of this, uranium ore cannot be mined by hand or by a burner mining drill , as it lacks fluid inputs. No additional sulfuric acid is consumed when additional products are created due to a productivity bonus from productivity modules or mining productivity . For example, with a 20% productivity bonus, 12 ore will be mined for every 10 sulfuric acid consumed. The ore has a green glow, making it easily seen at night. Assuming no productivity or reactor neighbor bonuses are involved, and if Kovarex enrichment process is used to convert excess uranium-238 into uranium-235, one uranium ore has a total energy value of 368.73 MJ when made into uranium fuel cells , about 92 times the energy of coal .

Raw fish is used to heal by clicking on the character or anywhere else in the world with the fish in the cursor. They heal 80 HP each and have a short cooldown for reuse, limiting the amount of incoming DPS that fish healing can absorb. Using a fish produces a munching sound. Using landfill on water where a fish is swimming will \"destroy\" the fish. Fish can be shot and killed via pistol or submachine gun , and also by explosions, but are immune to any kind of shotgun fire. Shooting fish does not grant any fish items.

They require an oil processing setup as they are produced using plastic bars . Advanced circuits are slower to build than most other intermediate components, require three inputs, and are in high demand. As an example of the demand, a finished productivity module 3 requires a total of 190 advanced circuits. Due to their slow build time, assembling machine 3s with speed modules may be useful in their production. Achievements Circuit veteran 1 Produce 1.0k advanced circuits per hour.

It has the highest energy density and vehicle bonuses of all the fuel types, providing an acceleration modifier of 250% (compared to rocket fuel 's 180%). The vehicle top speed modifier (115%) is the same as for rocket fuel. Nuclear fuel is made from rocket fuel and uranium-235 , one of each to produce one unit of nuclear fuel. Compared to rocket fuel, nuclear fuel not only gives a higher acceleration bonus, but also has more than twelve times the energy output per item. Despite its smaller Rocket capacity (10 vs 100), this gives nuclear fuel an advantage in Space Age when moving energy from a planet to a platform. However, due to the much smaller stack size (1 vs 20), it is less space-efficient. Trivia The fuel value of 1.21 GJ is a reference to the Back to the Future franchise, in which the DeLorean uses a nuclear reaction to generate \"1.21 Jigawatts\" of electricity. Ironically, Emmett Brown specifically refutes the idea that the DeLorean uses nuclear fuel; the energy of the reaction is used to power the flux capacitor that allows time travel, and in Part III he specifies the DeLorean's internal combustion engine has always run on ordinary gasoline.

The process has a 99.3% chance to produce 1 uranium-238 and a 0.7% chance to produce 1 uranium-235. Contents 1 Initiating the Kovarex enrichment process 1.1 Expected value 1.2 Confidence levels 2 Trivia 3 History 4 See also Initiating the Kovarex enrichment process Unlike most other crafting processes, uranium processing creates U-235 and U-238 based on probability, rather than in guaranteed deterministic amounts. Additionally, the Kovarex process requires a bulk stockpile of 40 units of the rare uranium-235 isotope to initiate in a single centrifuge. Therefore, planning uranium mining and processing for the Kovarex process takes certain considerations not encountered elsewhere in the game. Expected value As U-235 is created in centrifuges running uranium processing with p = 0.007 , the expected number of processing cycles to gain a single unit is E(1,p) = 1 ÷ p = ~143 . The expected number of cycles to gain 40 units is then E(40,p) = 40 × E(1,p) = ~5,714 cycles . Note that running this many cycles requires mining 57,140 uranium ore, a non-trivial task. However, given the nature of probability, it is impossible to guarantee that 40 units will be reached in this number of cycles; as a matter of fact, some mathematics yields that the probability that 5,714 cycles will produce at least 40 units of U-235 is only about 52%. As each cycle takes 12 seconds, it takes on average 12 * 143 = 1716 seconds to produce 1 U-235 (assuming no productivity or speed modules). This can be turned into 10 uranium fuel cells , each of which lasts 200 seconds, so in total 2000 seconds. That means one centrifuge constantly running can on average supply enough U-235 to produce enough fuel cells to continuously power one reactor. See Tutorial:Nuclear_power . The Kovarex enrichment process is a much more efficient way to produce U-235. Confidence levels Probability of reaching 40 U-235 from uranium processing by number of cycles (click to enlarge) Some further mathematics enables one to calculate the number of uranium processing cycles one must run to obtain at least 40 units of U-235 (given p = 0.007 ) with a given level of confidence (probability of achieving the set goal). As discussed in the previous section, the level of confidence corresponding to 5,714 cycles (for which the expected value of U-235 gained is 40) happens to be about 52% (or, in other words, with this number of cycles, one can expect to fail to reach 40 U-235 a bit less than once out of every 2 tries). Some further example confidence levels that may be of interest to players are given in the table below. Consult the chart to the right for custom values.

    "content": "Kovarex enrichment process Edit Recipe 60 + 40 + 5 → 41 + 2 Total raw 60 + 40 + 5 Prototype type recipe Internal name kovarex-enrichment-process Required technologies Produced by The Kovarex enrichment process is a method for reprocessing uranium in a centrifuge . Although the process requires a large amount of the much rarer uranium-235 to start, it can be a good way to get more use out of the available uranium ore . Contents 1 Purpose 2 Trivia 3 History 4 See also Purpose Uranium processing takes 10 uranium ore and returns 1 uranium-235 with 0.007 (0.7%) probability, or 1 uranium-238 with 0.993 (99.3%) probability, leading to an expected (though not guaranteed) 1 unit of uranium-235 per approximately 143 processing cycles (or about a 1:142 ratio of U-235 to U-238). This is currently the only probability-based crafting recipe in the base game. Uranium-235 is necessary to create uranium fuel cells and atomic bombs , in considerable quantities for the latter, but the probability distribution of uranium processing leads to it being produced slowly and creating large stockpiles of U-238 as a byproduct. The Kovarex process thus provides the player with a considerably faster (and deterministic) method of producing U-235, as well as a use for the surplus U-238. It should be noted that U-238 is not useless; it is needed to manufacture uranium rounds magazines , uranium cannon shells , and explosive uranium cannon shells , and is required as a secondary ingredient in uranium fuel cells. Therefore, it is not advisable to use the Kovarex process to convert all stockpiled U-238 into U-235. (Although, in case of shortage, Used up uranium fuel cells can be reprocessed into a modest amount of U-238.) Trivia The Kovarex enrichment process is named after Michal Kovařík , lead designer of Factorio and co-owner of Wube, whose online nick is kovarex (which he usually spells lowercase). [1] In the real world, uranium-235 is the most common fissile isotope of uranium and makes up approximately 0.72% of naturally-occurring uranium, with the other 99.28% being uranium-238 . The in-game representation is thus highly accurate in this regard. Uranium is commonly enriched in centrifuges by merely separating isotopes to increase the percentage of U for use in fission reactions. As the Kovarex enrichment process produces more fissile material than its input, the process is more akin to plutonium breeding . Reddit discussion: Kovarex enrichment is plutonium breeding… right? Uranium munitions are made from depleted uranium , a byproduct of uranium enrichment, which is mostly U whose natural admixture of the U isotope has been lowered even further through the enrichment process. Depleted uranium is minimally radioactive and the reason for its use in munitions is its very high density and other mechanical properties, not radioactivity/toxicity.

This article is about the result of an item's spoilage. For the article describing the mechanics of items spoiling, see Spoilage mechanics . Spoilage is an item generated by letting many spoilable items spoil. Many resources and intermediates produced on Gleba transform into spoilage, including agricultural science packs . Raw fish in Space Age also can spoil into spoilage. Spoilage can be directly harvested from stingfrond , sunnycomb , hairy clubnub and other flora present in Gleba. In addition, recycling nutrients will behave as if the nutrients were made using the nutrients from spoilage recipe, thereby yielding considerably more spoilage than simply allowing the nutrients to spoil naturally. While spoilage is generally a waste product, it does have a number of uses. The ability of an assembling machine 2 or better to transform spoilage into nutrients is useful on Gleba as a way to produce nutrients that does not require the biochamber (a building which uses nutrients as fuel).

Nutrients are the fuel for biochambers and are also used as ingredients in recipes. There are several ways to generate nutrients from biological materials. While nutrients have a short spoil time, their fuel value is not affected by their freshness. Any quality of nutrients can be used as fuel for a biochamber.

Lithium is the intermediary derived from lithium brine ; it is the only use for lithium brine. Producing it requires holmium plate , which must be shipped to Aquilo from Fulgora . Because neither ammonia nor lithium brine can be stored in barrels , and both resources can only be found on Aquilo, lithium must be produced on Aquilo. Besides, mining big or huge lithium ice formation alos yield some amount of lithium.

It is used in labs to research technologies . Unlike the other science packs, the space science pack has two different sources, depending if one is playing with Space Age or not. In the base game, space science is an end-game science pack and is not directly craftable. Instead, it is obtained by launching a rocket from a rocket silo equipped with a satellite . 1000 space science packs are delivered to the cargo landing pad each time a rocket with a satellite is launched. A cargo landing pad must be built somewhere on the map for a rocket to launch. Space science packs are used in all infinite technologies . In Space Age, space science is a mid-game science pack. It must be crafted on a space platform , from ingredients which are harvested by an asteroid collector somewhere on the platform, then crushed by crushers , and (in the case of iron ore) smelted by furnaces . (Wiki usage tip: to see the recipe, click on the \"Space Age mod\" tab in the infobox to the right.) Space science packs are needed for all subsequent technologies.

In Space Age , it is instead the only way to launch items and the player off Nauvis to orbiting space platforms to visit the neighboring planets of Vulcanus , Fulgora , Gleba , and Aquilo . Building a silo requires, among other things, electric engine units , processing units , and concrete , which all must be produced in assembling machines or foundries and cannot be crafted by hand from raw materials. The rocket itself can only be produced in the silo. Once the silo has been built and placed it can be filled with processing units , low density structure , and rocket fuel , which will create rocket parts within the silo. 100 rocket parts are needed to construct a rocket (50 parts in Space Age ). The silo accepts productivity modules , and due to the high resource cost of rockets, silos are a prime candidate for their use. Once constructed, the rocket will rise into position and can be launched. It is required to place a cargo landing pad somewhere on the planet in order to launch a rocket. Once a rocket has been constructed, the silo will continue to craft a second rocket within the silo. If both are constructed, once the first rocket has been launched, the second will rise into place without the silo going through its normal animation of closing and reopening its doors. This is particularly useful in Space Age when crafting speeds are faster and rockets are in increased demand.

It requires 10 low density structure, rocket fuel, and processing units to make 1 rocket part , for a total of 1,000 of each for a single rocket. Before a rocket can be launched, the player must place a cargo landing pad somewhere on the planet. The landing pad can be anywhere on the planet, with no restrictions on distance from the silo, but only one can be placed. Launching a rocket requires a payload and launching one for the first time will trigger the victory screen, which thanks the player for playing and invites them to keep growing their factory, with the options of exiting the game, viewing the credits, or continuing the game. The rocket can be launched manually by clicking the \"Launch\" button. Checking the \"Send to orbit automatically\" checkbox will make the rocket launch automatically once it has a payload. Only two items can be used as a payload. The first is a satellite ; launching a rocket with one of these will return a shipment of 1,000 space science packs to the cargo landing pad roughly 29 seconds after the launch is triggered. The second is a... Spoiler! Click to view. Raw fish : Grants the \"So long and thanks for all the fish!\" achievement. Other than this, it also wastes the launch. Space Age Space Age expansion exclusive feature. Basics In Space Age, the silo is unlocked far earlier in the game, requiring 1,000 of only automation , logistics and chemical science packs. The silo is a critical building for transporting items and the player offplanet to orbiting space platforms . Rockets are built identically to the base game, except that a single rocket part takes only 1 of each material instead of 10 and only 50 rocket parts are required per rocket. This means that a single rocket requires only 50 of each resource. The silo greatly benefits from higher quality productivity modules as well as the rocket part productivity infinite technology, both of which can reduce the cost of rockets even further. The rocket can be manually launched in one of three ways: Deliver cargo: launch with a payload of any size or composition at any orbiting platform New platform: if the silo contains exactly one space platform starter pack , clicking this will open the map and invite the player to enter a name for the new platform. Travel to platform: the rocket will launch to any orbiting platform with the player as its sole payload. The player can bring any equipped armor , their installed modules, and any weapons, but no ammo for those weapons. The rocket silo's GUI in Space Age Rocket capacity Unlike in the base game, a space age rocket can accept nearly every item in the game as a payload. This is expressed by the silo as a weight limit. Every item in the game has a rocket capacity which is the maximum number of items that can fit in a single rocket. An item's rocket capacity can be read by the circuit network by feeding an item into the selector combinator and choosing the respective mode of operation. As a general rule of thumb, the more complex the item, the fewer can fit within a rocket. Some items, like the rocket silo itself and the atomic bomb , are too heavy for rockets, and so the raw materials must be shipped to orbit individually and assembled on the destination planet. Fluids cannot be put in rockets, but full barrels can. Some fluids cannot be barreled, so they cannot be transported by rocket. This is notably the case for all the fluids that can only be obtained on Fulgora and Aquilo , except for fluoroketone . Orbital requests The rocket silo can detect requests from any space platform in orbit around the current planet. These can be satisfied in two ways. If \"Automatic requests from space platforms\" is not selected, the silo acts as a large container. Items can be inserted and removed with inserters . If the silo receives a full rocket of a single item that is requested, the rocket will automatically launch to the platform requesting that item, even if the payload is more than what is being requested. If multiple platforms are requesting the same item, the rocket will prioritize the earliest platform that the player created. If automatic requests is selected, the silo acts similar to a requester chest . Logistic robots will fill the silo automatically from the logistic network (including from buffer chests ), and the rocket will launch automatically when full, unless the requesting platform has set a minimum payload to a lower amount than a full load. If there are items in the rocket inventory when this box is selected, those items will be moved to the silo's trash slots and be removed by logistics robots. Regardless of option selected, the rocket will only launch automatically when it contains at least one item. The silo can be connected to the circuit network , with two output functions. Output requests: Outputs the sum of requests from all orbiting platforms, if any. A request is considered satisfied and will be removed from the output the instant the rocket launch is triggered, not when the delivery to the platform actually happens. Output contents: Outputs the contents of the rocket silo. If automatic requests is selected, this option will do nothing. Maximum throughput In the base game, a fully moduled silo has +611% crafting speed from beacons and +40% productivity. Modules accelerate crafting time in the first phase, but have no effect on animations in the other phases. There are five phases to a rocket launch. Working Rocket parts must be assembled in the silo before the rocket can be deployed. The best possible time to assemble 100 rocket parts, based on the rocket part recipe and the module effects, is 1250 ticks, or ~20.833 seconds. 1250 ticks elapsed. Preparing rocket for launch The rocket is brought up out of the silo so a payload can be inserted, if any. This animation lasts 890 ticks, or ~14.833 seconds. 2140 ticks elapsed. Waiting to launch rocket The payload must be inserted. One fast inserter arm swing to insert a Satellite is 14 ticks, or ~0.233 seconds. 2154 ticks elapsed. Launching rocket The rocket is launched with the payload. This phase ends when the result inventory appears inside the silo. 1162 ticks, or ~19.367 seconds. 3316 ticks elapsed. Reset The silo door must close before the cycle begins again. 368 ticks, or ~6.133 seconds. If a second rocket was buffered within the silo, this step is skipped. Conclusions Grand Total: 3684 ticks , which gives a total cycle time of ~61.417 seconds, including time spent building rocket parts and inserting the payload. With a build time of 1250 + 14, the delay from animations is 2420 ticks. [1] Space Age In Space Age, the rocket silo gained the ability to buffer a second rocket ready to load and launch [2] . If a second rocket is ready, then the rocket silo skips the door close/open animation. This results in a rocket launch approximately every 27 seconds, with sufficient speed and/or productivity bonuses (enough to get 111 rocket parts per minute). Achievements The rocket silo, which is used to win the base game, is directly connected to the following game-win-based achievements: Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast Launch a rocket to space. No time for chitchat Launch a rocket to space within 15 hours. There is no spoon Launch a rocket to space within 8 hours. Raining bullets Launch a rocket to space without building any laser turrets . Steam all the way Launch a rocket to space without building any solar panels . Logistic network embargo Finish research with space science pack for the base game or any planetary science pack for Space Age without building any active provider , buffer , or requester chests . So long and thanks for all the fish Trivia Prior to version 2.0 , the rocket could accept any item as cargo; however, most did nothing in particular and simply wasted the launch. Notable exceptions included: Spoiler! Click to view. Vehicles : When a vehicle was inserted into the payload slot, the player could enter the rocket like they would any other vehicle, then launch and ride it. This allowed a fast-moving view of one's base (as the game world is internally 2-dimensional, the rocket actually simply moved north along the map), and then returned the player next to the launching silo once the launch animation had finished. If all space near the rocket silo is occupied, the player is placed at spawn instead. Wasted the launch, as the rocket's sole payload slot is occupied by the vehicle, rather than a satellite. (Having any number of satellites in the car's trunk or the \"astronaut\"s inventory does not count.) Space science pack : Returned one raw fish for every science pack that was launched, but no more than 100 raw fishes per launch.

It acts as an 8×8 passive provider chest with a capacity of 80 slots. Only one can be placed on the surface at a time. Inserters can pull items out of it like any other container, but cannot insert into the landing pad. When the rocket silo sends a rocket with a satellite into space, the cargo landing pad will receive 1,000 space science packs . If the landing pad is full, the science will be deposited on the ground and marked for deconstruction. The science will be delivered to the landing pad regardless of its distance from the rocket silo. The landing pad can be connected to the circuit network to read its contents like other containers. Space Age In Space Age , the cargo landing pad further acts as a hub for orbital deliveries. It acts as a requester chest for orbiting space platforms . Platforms that are stopped over the current planet may have their cargo dropped down to satisfy the landing pad's requests. The landing pad can only receive one stack of items at a time. Placing a cargo bay that is touching the landing pad next to at least one tile will increase the landing pad's inventory size by 20 slots each (increasable with higher quality ) and increase the number of item stacks that can be dropped from the platform at once. If a landing pad's inventory is full, a platform will not drop any cargo until a slot is free. If the trash unrequested box is ticked, the landing pad will automatically move all items from its inventory that are not currently requested to its trash slots.

Nearly any building can be placed on the foundation to add to the functionality of a space platform. They are also essential components for the space platform starter pack , which creates a space platform when launched with a rocket . The starting space platform will not be large enough for other buildings, so more space platform foundations must be sent to the platform to extend its size. Notes Each platform starter pack comes with 10 space platform foundations in the inventory and 36 space platform foundations placed around the Space platform hub. Space platforms cannot be built with holes in them. If the player tries to create the hole, the space platform foundation will not build and will display a warning. It takes 5 space platform foundations to increase a ship's weight by one ton (200kg or 0.2 tons per platform). This is different from the rocket launch weight of 20 kg per Space platform foundation (50 tiles / 1000kg = 20kg). When building a space platform from a blueprint or remote map view, each tile has a 1-second expansion animation. Each space platform foundation will do the expansion animation on its three exposed faces for 1 tile of length before repeating.

Cargo bays extend the storage capability and rate of receiving items for a space platform hub or a cargo landing pad . To provide this bonus, cargo bays must be placed either directly adjacent to a part of the hub/landing pad or to another cargo bay that itself is attached to the hub/pad (or to another bay that is attached... etc). The connection does not need to cover all 4 tiles of one side of the bay; it may only cover two tiles horizontally or vertically. There can be any number of bays attached to a hub/pad. The cargo bay snaps to a 2×2 grid, like the landing pad and rails . Inserters cannot interact with cargo bays at all; they can only interact with the hub/pad. Since cargo bays must also be adjacent to the hub/pad, this creates a tradeoff between the ability to insert or remove items from the storage and the ability to expand that storage. Cargo bays cannot be mined if the attached hub/pad's is so full that losing the bay's inventory expansion would cause it to be over-full. Although the inventory size bonus is significantly less useful for a cargo landing pad compared to a similar number of chests , each cargo bay also increases the number of cargo pods that can be received by the cargo landing pad or sent/received by a space platform at the same time. This is important for increasing overall item throughput of bases that rely on frequent orbital transport.

The crusher is a building for the space platform that crushes small asteroid chunks into usable resources. To collect the asteroid chunks, they must first be grabbed by an asteroid collector . There are three types of recipes that can be performed by the crusher: Basic crushing : These recipes break the chunk into a significant volume of one usable resource, with a small a chance of also reproducing the chunk it consumed. You have to design your crushing setups to deal with the chunk byproduct without clogging up the system. Advanced crushing : These recipes break the chunk into two useful resources, though at a lower volume of output than the standard crushing recipes. It can still regenerate the chunk, but it has a much lower chance to do so. Reprocessing : These recipes attempt to transform the chunk into a different kind of chunk. The original type is usually reproduced, with a smaller chance of producing a different kind of chunk or nothing at all. The chance of producing each chunk type is rolled independently, so reprocessing one chunk can potentially return up to three new chunks.

Adding a metallic asteroid (or iron ore) to the belt will change the recipe to metallic asteroid crushing, because that recipe has a higher priority. Reprocessing recipes can't be selected via item signals because all of the output items for those recipes are also shared with the asteroid crushing recipes.

You can help this wiki by expanding it . Space Age expansion exclusive feature. Thrusters are components of space platforms that propel the platforms through space, and to other planets. Thrusters require both thruster fuel and thruster oxidizer to function. Thrusters can only be built on the south edge of a space platform, with nothing directly south in the path of their exhaust. This placement means space platforms always travel north toward the top of the screen. Thrusters are operated via the space platform hub . When a destination is set and the switch set to \"Automatic,\" thrusters turn on and move the platform toward its destination. They turn off by themselves when the destination is reached. Moving the switch back to \"Paused thrust\" will turn all thrusters off immediately. Speed and acceleration are affected by the number of thrusters, their efficiency, and the mass of the platform. Thrusters are at their least efficient when they have full reserves of both fuel and oxidizer, but produce higher speed and acceleration. Partly empty reserves cause them to work more efficiently, as noted in the table below, at the expense of speed/acceleration. Depending on speed, damaging asteroids are encountered in greater numbers. This means that defenses should be built before turning on the thrusters, and high thrust requires stronger defense. Datasheet The \"Relative thrust\" and \"Relative fluid consumption\" is the percentage for the range of a thruster of that Quality . 50% relative thrust is halfway between the minimum thrust and the maximum thrust. For a base quality thruster, 50% is 55.95 MN, while for a legendary thruster, it is 139.45 MN, a 150% increase.

The space platform hub is the centralized base of operations for a player's space platform , therefore it is the most important part of the platform. If the hub is completely destroyed, the entire platform is lost, which sends the player back to the planet they were last at prior to launching themselves into space. The space platform hub is not built normally like other buildings, but is instead automatically created when a space platform starter pack has been launched into space. If a platform is lost, another space platform starter pack must be created and sent into space again. When the player launches themselves to a platform, they will remain in the hub, unable to leave or move around. The following things can be accessed when clicking on a hub: The hub's inventory seen at the center, which can be expanded using cargo bays , which increase the inventory space when attached to the hub.

Large parts of these are covered with trees . Sandy Desert has barren terrain, with a few dead trees scattered about. Red Desert Natural Resources The native raw resources on Nauvis are Iron ore , Copper ore , Coal , Stone , Uranium ore , Crude oil , Water , Wood , and Raw fish . Among these, only water and crude oil are renewable with local research , as their sources do not run dry. Out of these nine resources, the first five are found in ore patches and harvested using a Burner mining drill , an Electric mining drill , or a Big mining drill . In addition, Uranium Ore requires a constant supply of Sulfuric acid in order for the drills to function and can't be mined using Burner mining drill. Water is harvested by placing an Offshore pump on the side of a lake. It will produce water indefinitely, as water does not run out. It requires no energy or fuel. Crude oil is harvested by placing a Pumpjack on an oil field. It requires energy to function. With continuous use, the same oil field will produce oil at a gradually slower rate, but this decrease in production will stop when production is at 20% of its initial value, making crude oil a renewable resource on Nauvis. Stone, coal, wood, and raw fish can be obtained by mining naturally spawning entities. (In case of stone and coal, this is in addition to being found in ore patches.) Mining a Rock will yield stone, and if it is \"huge\", it will also yield coal. Trees yield wood when mined. Finally, \"mining\" a fish (shown as a dark, moving spot in water) will yield the fish as five items. Mechanics Pollution Main article: Pollution On Nauvis, many buildings produce pollution while active. This pollution is local to the chunk on which it is produced, but will spread to other chunks over time.

Ashlands are plateaus speckled with sparse vegetation and deposits of coal . They are home to leafless alien trees. They are relatively free of cliffs and lava, making them ideal for building. Lava basins are filled with winding lava rivers. Within them are deposits of tungsten ore , which can only be mined using the big mining drill. Mountains are large volcanoes, covered in cliffs and with a large lava pool at their center. They are home to sulfuric acid geysers and calcite . Demolisher territories Demolisher patrolling. Native to Vulcanus are the giant centipede-like enemies known as \" demolishers \". Demolishers have well-defined territories. On the map, these territories are outlined by an opaque, bright red line and the inside is marked by diagonal, translucent, red lines. Only one demolisher will spawn per territory, and the territories themselves do not overlap. However, they are tightly packed, as they follow a Voronoi-like pattern. At the start of the game, only Vulcanus' starting area is not inside a demolisher's territory. When left alone, a demolisher will patrol the border of its territory. However, if players build inside of a demolisher's territory, it will soon make a beeline towards these buildings with the intent of destroying them. Building inside of a demolisher's territory is therefore extremely risky and dangerous. The death of a demolisher is permanent, as they only spawn during world generation. Likewise, upon the death of a demolisher, its territory permanently becomes free for the player to use, as other demolishers will not try to expand their territories. Access to basic resources Water can be obtained via acid neutralisation and steam condensation Stone is a byproduct of processing lava into molten iron/copper. Iron ore is only available in limited quantities from mining volcanic rock , but iron plate and concrete may be obtained from molten iron Copper ore is only available in limited quantities from mining volcanic rock , but copper plate may be obtained from molten copper . Coal can be mined from patches on the surface as normal. Crude oil is not available, but heavy oil can be obtained via simple coal liquefaction . Heavy oil can then be cracked into light oil and petroleum. Once metallurgic science is produced and a stockpile of heavy oil built up, this can be switched to regular coal liquefaction . Wood cannot be obtained, but medium electric poles can be constructed using the small amount of ores available. Note that this can soft-lock players that did not unlock the research. Power production Solar panels on Vulcanus give 4× the power they would on Nauvis. Acid neutralization generates 500°C steam, which can be fed through steam turbines to generate electricity. The calcite processing technology does not actually give the player access to steam turbines, so steam engines can be used instead (which generate less power for the same steam).

Surface Properties Gleba Surface Properties Property Value Pollutant Type Spores Day Night Cycle 10 Minutes Magnetic Field 10 Solar Power 50% Pressure 2000 Gravity 20 Biomes Gleba's terrain consists of elevated regions of dry, buildable terrain and marshy lower areas marbled with Shallow water that cannot directly be built upon without landfill . The dark highlands biome are where stone may be found. The orange or turquoise midland biomes are also elevated and lack shallow water. Cliffs usually represent the transition from lower lying areas to higher ones. Pentapod enemies can only build nests on shallow water tiles (regardless of biome), so midlands and highlands act as natural barriers to their expansion. Artificial barriers can be created by using landfill on available shallow water. The blue biomes are marshes that are typically found next to deep water lakes. Outside of their particular flora, these lands contain nothing special. The red and green biomes are marshlands where Jellystem and Yumako trees can be found, respectively. They also contain copper and iron stromatolites in abundance, making them good sources of ore and ore bacteria. For the purposes of where crops can be planted, each of these two biomes has 3 kinds of tiles. Fertile soil tiles are those surrounding natural Jellystems and Yumako trees . These tiles can be planted with seeds and grow trees without any additional intervention. However, there are usually not very many such tiles in a biome. Around fertile soil tiles are a larger number of wetland tiles. These are shallow water tiles that are not initially plantable, but artificial jellynut and yumako soil tiles will make them fertile. The vast majority of the biome consists of darker red or green tiles (some are shallow water marshes, while others are buildable terrain) of types other than the above. All of these tiles can have overgrowth jellynut and yumako soils placed on them, making virtually the entire biome farmable (though at substantial cost). On the map view, the lightest colored tiles in these biomes are fertile soils, the slightly darker tiles around them are wetlands, and the rest are  tiles that can have overgrowth soils placed on them. Note that the overgrowth soils can be placed on the same wetland tiles that artificial soils can be placed on. Overgrowth soils have no special effects on those tiles, and they are far more expensive than artificial soils. As such, care should be taken to avoid using the more expensive soils where the less expensive ones will do fine. Mechanics Main article: Spoilage mechanics Most biological products on Gleba are \"spoilable\". A spoilable item has an inherent timer attached to it, which begins at the item's creation. When the timer reaches 0, the item is transformed into spoilage , with a few exceptions. This process is inevitable and cannot be stopped. The exact time differs per item, ranging anywhere from a few minutes to 2 hours. This means that item throughput is more important than ever on Gleba, and buffering a large stockpile is ineffective, as items can spoil within containers. The Biochamber , Gleba's special production building, uses a fuel source, nutrients . Nutrients also can spoil, and have a short, 5 minute spoil time. Access to basic resources Water is readily available using offshore pumps Stone can be mined from patches on the surface as normal Iron ore can be obtained from iron bacteria , which can be cultivated in a biochamber using iron bacteria cultivation Copper ore can be obtained from copper bacteria , which can be cultivated in a biochamber using copper bacteria cultivation Coal can be obtained via coal synthesis Crude oil is not available. However: Plastic bars can be obtained from bioplastic Sulfur can be obtained from biosulfur Lubricant can be obtained from biolubricant Rocket fuel can be obtained from rocket fuel from jelly Heavy oil can be obtained using coal liquefaction , if the initial heavy oil is shipped in from another planet. This is only really useful for flamethrower turrets , since all other oil products can be obtained more efficiently using the bio recipes. Simple coal liquefaction is also an option if the calcite is shipped in from space platforms using advanced oxide asteroid crushing or from Vulcanus . Power production The heating tower is a burner device can be used to generate electricity via the use of heat exchangers and steam turbines. Gleba renewably generates all its resources, which includes rocket fuel. Traditional boilers can also be used.

Its surface is split between island-like plateaus, and deep oilsands. During the night, the planet is ravaged by lightning storms, damaging buildings. Planet discovery Fulgora (research) is required to travel to the planet.

Plateaus are islands dotted around the landscape. They are the only biome where factories can be built. Some plateaus are home to alien ruins , which have fulgoran lightning attractors , which can protect your buildings until unlocking your own lightning rods . Other plateaus hold scrap , Fulgora's sole resource. Oilsands are the lowlands between the plateaus. No buildings can be built in them except for rail supports . You can walk through them, but occasional oilpatches will slow you to a crawl. An offshore pump can be placed on the edge of oilsands to produce an unlimited amount of heavy oil . Terrain Fulgoran terrain is mainly composed of oillands , on which nothing except for rail supports can be built. Traversal by foot across the oillands is possible, but slow. The oillands are further divided into deep and shallow areas, with deep areas slowing down player movement even further and not even allowing for rail supports to be built until rail support foundations (research) is researched. However, the oillands are also scattered with islands of various sizes, on which normal construction is possible. At first, these are the only place on Fulgora where factories can be built, as foundation for building on top of the oillands requires research that can not be performed until much later. The islands come in three size classes: Small islands with high amounts of resources, but with little room to build on Medium islands with lower amounts of resources, and with sufficient room for a small factory Large islands with no resources, but with enough room to build the main part of a medium-sized factory It is possible for two or more islands to overlap, potentially creating an even larger island that does have local resources. However, most islands are detached, meaning that transport between islands will have to occur by train. In many cases, the distance between two islands is also too vast for roboports or big electric poles to reach, thus requiring local logistic and electric networks to be built, as neither roboports nor power poles can be built on the oillands without foundation . Islands are also scattered with fulgorite , Fulgoran lightning attractors , Fulgoran ruins and Fulgoran vault ruins , allowing players without the recycler to get access to basic resources. Mechanics Lightning During nighttime , dense thunderstorms occur on Fulgora, with frequent lightning strikes occurring across the surface. Lightning will strike each chunk once, every 10 seconds or so ( lightnings_per_chunk_per_tick = 1 / (60 * 10), --cca once per chunk every 10 seconds (600 ticks) ) If a lightning strike is set to occur near a lightning rod , lightning collector , or Fulgoran lightning attractor , then the lightning will always hit said entity, rendering the lightning harmless. However, if such an entity can not be found, the lightning will strike where it occurs, causing damage to nearby entities. Lightning will prefer striking the entity with the highest priority, choosing randomly between entities tied for highest priority. Lightning priority above 1 Entity Priority value Lightning collector 10,000 Lightning rod 1,000 Fulgoran lightning attractor 1,000 Fulgoran vault ruin 95 Colossal Fulgoran ruin 94 Huge Fulgoran ruin 93 Big Fulgoran ruin 92 Medium Fulgoran ruin 91 Lightning priority 1 Entities Category Anything with the \"Metal\" impact soundset/category?

They convert lightning into stored power, which they quickly discharge into the local electric system . With enough accumulators to last during daytime or between lightning strikes, this can serve as the factory's main power source. With this, lightning on Fulgora become both a curse and a blessing: Players must keep their factory covered by lightning rods or collectors to avoid damage, and nighttime exploration becomes dangerous and risky. However, to an established base, lightning become a convenient source of electric energy, which is especially important given the weak solar output on Fulgora's surface and the difficulty of setting up a global electric network on Fulgora before foundation becomes available. Natural resources Aside from numerous items that can be collected by mining ancient ruins, only two \"natural\" resources occur on Fulgora, those being heavy oil and scrap . Heavy oil can be obtained in infinite and non-diminishing amounts by placing an offshore pump on the shore of an island, allowing it to collect heavy oil directly from the oillands. Scrap is found in deposits on small and medium sized islands, as if it were an ore. However, in stark contrast to most other natural resources, scrap is not directly processed into a single basic resource like iron or copper plates using traditional production methods. Rather, it is recycled to produce a variety of items. Players can also recycle by hand provided the recipe has been unlocked. Input Output Chance Rate Scrap Iron gear wheel 20% 0.5/s Solid fuel 7% 0.175/s Concrete 6% 0.15/s Ice 5% 0.125/s Steel plate 4% 0.1/s Battery 4% 0.1/s Stone 4% 0.1/s Copper cable 3% 0.075/s Advanced circuit 3% 0.075/s Processing unit 2% 0.05/s Low density structure 1% 0.025/s Holmium ore 1% 0.025/s Since this list includes intermediate products, such as processing units , but no iron or copper plates, players are generally forced to further recycle many of these items in order to obtain their ingredients. Players are thus left with the decision of what items to recycle, all while having to avoid cluttering their belts with unused resources. Access to basic resources Water can be obtained from ice (from recycling scrap ) via ice melting Stone can be obtained by recycling scrap Iron ore can be obtained by recycling concrete Iron plate can be obtained by recycling iron gear wheel , battery , or electronic circuit Copper plate can be obtained by recycling copper cable , battery , or low density structure Coal cannot be obtained and must be shipped in from other planets. However: Plastic bar can be obtained by recycling advanced circuit or low density structure There are no enemies on-planet, so explosives -based ammunition or grenades are not needed Crude oil is not available, but heavy oil is readily available using offshore pumps Copper ore is not available as the only recipe it is used in is copper plates and smelting processes cannot be reversed Space routes Fulgora is connected to 3 other planets: Nauvis , Gleba , and Aquilo .

Access to basic resources Water can be obtained via ammoniacal solution separation and ice melting Stone is not available and must be shipped in from other planets Iron ore is not available and must be shipped in from other planets Copper ore is not available and must be shipped in from other planets Coal is not available and must be shipped in from other planets Crude oil can be obtained using pumpjacks as normal Mechanics The starting area on Aquilo is a relatively small patch of snow and ice terrain. Beyond this small platform are the vast ammoniacal seas, which have small dots of icey terrain in them, usually around crude oil , fluorine , or lithium brine resource geysers. Aquilo is notable for having nothing to drill with any kind of miner. All natural resources, spare the lithium ice formations , are gathered either by an offshore pump or pumpjack . Bases on Aquilo will be reliant on regularly shipping in resources from other planets. Ice terrain On Aquilo, most terrain must be constructed, but landfill and foundation are no help. Instead, you must use ice platforms . These platforms are created by first using ammoniacal solution separation to make ice and ammonia , then re-combining those into a platform that can be placed on the ocean like landfill . Snowy terrain can be built on directly, but on any kind of ice terrain or ice platform , most buildings will require an insulating floor of concrete tiles or derivatives before they can be placed. Stone Bricks can not be used to pave ice. Freezing Aquilo is brutally cold. The harsh ambient temperatures drain the energy from any airborne construction robots and logistic robots , making them consume 5 times more power than normal. Most buildings will freeze and stop working unless heated by a heat pipe or heat generator. Heat can be generated by the nuclear reactor or heating tower . Once a building is adjacent to a heat source above 30°C, it will consume heat energy to maintain its state, reducing the energy (and temperature) in the heat source. Different entities consume different amounts of heat to prevent freezing. Notes Underground belts and pipes to ground are substantially larger heat drains than their above-ground versions Heat pipes do not lose heat to the environment; they only lose heat to entities that need to be kept warm. All burner entities and heat-producing machines are immune to freezing. For details on heat throughput, see the heat pipe page. A building is adjacent to a heat source when it is one tile away from the heat source either orthogonally or diagonally. All of the pipes would be heated in the below example: Entity Heat Consumption Building Kilowatts 10 50 100 150 200 40 1 150 30 100 20 30 30 50 50 50 50 50 100 100 100 200 300 400 The following Entities are immune from freezing.

Tile Entities Category Space Cargo Offshore Pumps Chests Electric Poles Basic Electric Devices Player Notification Devices Burner Entities Heat Generators and Heat Pipes Fusion Power Tesla Turrets Flamethrower Turrets Walls and Gates Bots Vehicles Trains Rail Pieces Any Rail Pieces Solar energy Aquilo is far from its sun, and so solar panels on its surface only output at 1% of their rate on Nauvis: 0.6 kW peak production. This makes panels practical for little more than powering the first machines to produce the water needed for real power generation. The minimum machines needed to produce water is either a single chemical plant to melt ice (which can initially be dropped from a space platform), or a single assembling machine 2 to empty barrels of water also dropped from the platform. Assembling machine 2s require less power than chemical plants, and the unbarreling recipe is faster than ice melting . So on the whole, the assembler version will be faster. Note that it is not necessary to fully power these machines. As long as the available power is greater than their drain, they will be able to function, albeit at reduced speed. Efficiency modules can speed this process up. With 3 efficiency modules, an assembling machine 2 only needs 35 kW to run at full speed (59 solar panels). To reach just 1/8th of max speed requires only 8.75 kW, which only needs 15 (base quality ) solar panels. Once even a little water is available, heat exchangers heated by either heating towers or nuclear reactors can feed steam turbines for power. This power can be used to process ammoniacal solution separation to generate ice, which can be melted into water for continuous power generation.

The railgun is an extremely powerful player-equipped rifle that fires an electromagnetically accelerated projectile at its target, penetrating everything in its path nearly instantly. Railgun ammo is the only type of ammunition it can use. The weapon has a very slow firing rate, but makes up for this with its high damage, meaning the player must make their shots count when facing down hordes of dangerous enemies . It is also very effective against demolishers , because the railgun can snipe through each individual segment, causing massive damage. Trivia The weapon was part of the game's data before Space Age was released, but was not officially part of normal gameplay until the release of the expansion.

It fires in a spread pattern. The shotgun will fire without hostile targets nearby, can damage walls (it won't shoot over them) and other friendly structures, thus requiring significantly more caution when used, compared to most other weapons. For early Biter nests assaults, shotgun ammo represents a massive boost on resource efficiency, with 2 copper plates and 2 iron plates giving a stack of shotgun shells , dealing a total of 600 damage. Contrast this against the pistol 's firearm magazine , which costs 4 iron plates and deals a total of 50 damage. The shotgun is less effective in clearing out the biters themselves, because pellet spread will cause a nontrivial fraction of pellets to miss against small targets. Players can switch between the shotgun and submachine gun to balance power and resource-efficiency, or support themselves with covering fire from Turrets and combat bots .

Once they are made available, they surpass their regular variant; their damage and piercing power is increased, leaning more towards physical damage improvement. Since regular shells are still specifically required to manufacture uranium variants, any previously manufactured stockpile can be \"upgraded\" without waste. The piercing power of the shells has little practical use in spite of its improvement, which can be made insignificant since the enemy may often \"outgrow\" it by the time this ammunition is obtained. Its raw damage advantage otherwise found in the non-uranium explosive shell is also no longer as substantial; because of the kinetic energy nature of uranium-based ammunition, uranium cannon shells receive a much greater improvement overall, \"catching up\" in terms of raw damage potential, making explosive shell use on explosive-resistant enemies like worms , nests and especially spitters even more discouraging. However, this imbalance can be limited through research , and its area-of-effect damage has undeniable benefits.

They deal incredible damage over a wide area, capable of wiping out groups of enemies with ease. They can also kill even the most heavily-armored player, so they should be fired from a great distance. Instead of dealing all of its damage in a single explosion, the atomic bomb creates two waves of 1000 small, high-damage explosions in an expanding ring. One wave of explosions expands to a radius of 7 with each of the 1000 explosions dealing 100 damage in a radius of 3. The second wave of explosions expands to cover a radius of 35 and each of the 1000 explosions deals 400 damage in a radius of 3. This results in high damage at the center of the atomic bomb, which decreases towards the edge of the 35-tile radius. The impact of the atomic bomb creates a black scorch mark in a 12-tile radius that never disappears and is visible from the map. All tiles in an oval approximately 24 tiles wide and 17 tiles high will be converted into nuclear ground, which affects pollution absorption and prevents the removal of any former landfill and foundation tiles in the blast radius. Furthermore, the atomic bomb will permanently destroy cliffs and decorative objects in a 9-14 tile radius around the center. In Space Age , detonating an atomic bomb on Vulcanus or Aquilo will replace ground tiles with lava and ammonia respectively instead of nuclear ground. All mineable resources and sulfuric acid geysers on the affected tiles will be destroyed in the process; fluorine vents and lithium brine deposits are unaffected.

The damage from multiple poison capsules can stack. This is one of the most effective ways of removing trees . Poison capsules can be used to effectively kill worms as they are stationary. This technique is a relatively safe and cheap way to eliminate clusters of worms - it takes 5 poison capsules to kill a big Worm and the capsules can be thrown from outside the big Worm's spitting range. Since spawners are not affected by poison damage, poison capsules are useless against them.

They provide only a small amount of power, and only during the daytime. Portable solar panels can be used to slowly recharge energy shields out of combat, but are nearly useless for personal laser defense or exoskeleton , even with a large number of batteries . Portable solar panels are 1×1 in size and are therefore primarily used in modular armor , which has a 5×5 grid that cannot usefully hold a much more powerful 4×4 portable fission reactor or portable fusion reactor . (It could store one, but there would be no room for anything to use the power.) The more advanced armors should almost always use portable fusion reactors instead.

It consumes 200kW (200kJ/s) of power when used. They can be toggled on and off in the shortcut bar , assuming the player is wearing one. Exoskeleton is a kind of equipment module . It can be used by placing it in the grid that opens by right clicking the armor. Exoskeletons can also be placed into the equipment grid of vehicles like the spidertron and the tank to increase their movement speed. Exoskeletons also increase the flying speed of the mech armor . Each exoskeleton occupies a 2×4 tall rectangle in the equipment grid.  It is possible to use multiple exoskeletons, and the speed bonus will stack additively. There is no speed limit; it is limited only by the amount of room available in the equipment grid and by available power. Exoskeletons have a 56kJ internal electricity storage, visible as a charging bar.  With no power, this will sustain them for less than a second.  As the available power approaches 200kW, the charging bar will both drain more slowly and have a larger minimum size.  The exoskeleton will provide a full speed bonus until the charging bar hits the minimum size, at which point the exoskeleton's speed bonus drops to what it can maintain.  At 200kW or greater, the charging bar does not shrink and the speed bonus remains at maximum. Note that exoskeletons are below shields in armor charging priority, and if the shields are damaged at all, exoskeletons will rapidly run dry and will not resume their full speed until the shields are fully charged.

Just like other robots, if a personal robot runs out of energy it will reduce its speed but continue its attempt to catch up with the player.

Having nightvision in the armor during the night changes the standard vision at night to be brighter with a slight grey overlay that drains non-lit areas of color. Unlike other items such as exoskeletons or shields, equipping multiple night vision units has no effect. Nightvision turns off and requires no energy during the day time. Nightvision requires a suit energy supply to function. Unfortunately its complementary tech portable solar panel does not provide energy at night, and the Nightvision's internal buffer of 120 kJ will quickly drain in a few seconds.

They can be used to shield turrets so they will be able to fight enemies longer without being destroyed, and can be used to protect parts of the factory from enemies. Although walls have less health than most defensive structures, their high damage resistance means it will take longer for enemies to destroy them. Gates can be constructed to allow the player to pass through walls. Gates share the same health and resistances as walls and automatically close for enemies if not connected to the circuit network , so no defensive power is lost. Walls only block melee attacks, projectile attacks go over them. However, big and behemoth biters can attack 2 tiles away, meaning they can hit structures directly behind a single layer of walls. To prevent this, structures can be moved further back from the walls or a second layer of walls can be added. Despite their applications as a defensive measure, walls are not considered a military unit and structure ; this is important for understanding the behavior of enemies regarding walls. If they are attempting to attack something and the wall obstructs their path, they will attack the wall to destroy it and clear the way. However, if they have already been aggro'd by a turret or the player, enemies will more actively pursue their aggressor and not necessarily attack walls between them. This allows the player to stall enemies more efficiently by building walls in a manner that disrupts their pathing without entirely obstructing it. However, if their pathing is disrupted enough, they will still resort to attacking the wall to remove the obstruction, thus long sections of wall that enemies will chew through may be less effective than shorter segments that force them to go around. Placing walls in four adjacent tiles forming a square will cause the inner space to be filled. This is only a visual property, the health and the rest of the properties of the walls are not affected.

Gates can be placed as parts of walls, and have the same strength as a wall. Multiple gates placed adjacent to each other will merge into a single longer gate. They can also be placed over rails to create train gates. Contents 1 Mechanics 2 Circuit Network Interaction 3 History 4 See also Mechanics A gate will open for the player and their vehicles when they approach. The gate will not open for biters; they must destroy the gate unless they can get the player to stand close enough to the gate so that it opens. Gates have the same defensive strength as a wall. Normal gates will open whenever a player is within a few tiles, and is on foot or in a non-train vehicle. Train gates will open: Whenever a normal gate would open for players on foot or driving; Whenever a player is driving a train in manual mode, is on the same track as the gate, and is within a certain distance; and Whenever a train is in automatic mode, has its planned path go through the gate, and is within a certain distance. A gate's opening radius appears to be dependent on the player or vehicle's speed that is heading toward it, so as to ensure it opens in time. A player walking at the gate without any speed boosts will cause the gate to open about 4-5 tiles from the gate. A train traveling at full speed towards a gate will cause the gate to open several tiles away. This behavior is similar with all vehicles. A gate will stay open if there is a player/vehicle about 2-3 tiles away from it. If a player stands just outside of this radius, it is possible that the gate may not open in time should they run towards it with an enhanced speed (for example, using exoskeletons ). Defenders should also be careful to ensure they do not let enemy forces in accidentally, as they may pass through when the gate is down. Circuit Network Interaction Gates can be connected to the Circuit network by connecting either red wire or green wire to a wall adjacent to the gate. When connected, the wall sprite will show a small yellow electronic box on the top of the wall, and settings for the gate can be shown and changed by interacting with the gate wall. This allows the gate to be controlled by the attached circuit network, and allows the gate to send a signal to the network when it is attempted to be opened by a player or vehicle. This can be used to make safe rail crossings and a player detector, among other uses.

It can be used to provide a small area of remote vision on the map; it also allows periodic scanning of distant chunks around it. The radar has a high power demand (300kW) so a radar indirectly contributes to pollution when powered by boilers and steam engines . A radar can be continuously powered by eight solar panels and six accumulators . Seven solar panels and five accumulators is the most efficient; it gives the radar full power all but a short time in the morning, but never dips below the 20% power threshold for nearby scanning. Despite being categorized as a military building, the radar will not be attacked by enemies unless it blocks their path to another target, which means that radars can be safely placed in biter-infested areas without needing to be defended. The radar will show enemy lifeforms and structures, as well as trains , cars , and other players in the scanned area.

This nearby area is updated as a single pulse approximately every second. At reduced power levels, this nearby pulse scan will take longer, which can lead to 'blinking' on the player's map similar to the long range scan. This is particularly noticeable at dawn and dusk on solar powered radar stations. At 20% power the radar will pulse about every 4 seconds which will still keep the nearby area continuously lit on the map, but will provide reduced detail. 20% power can be achieved by a single solar panel , or by using one isolating accumulator for every 5 radars. The Roboport also charts a 5x5 area. Long range survey scanning The radar charts one distant chunk every time the sector scanning progress bar fills. This will take 33.333 seconds, if the radar is receiving full power. Mouse-over or click-open the radar details to see this progress bar. Long range scanning is visible on the map as a single chunk lighting up for several seconds, then slowly darkening. It scans the unexplored chunks first, represented by the black areas on the map. Note that it also generates the chunks if they weren't generated at the time of the scan. One chunk scan takes 10 MJ of energy to complete. Since the radar draws 300 kW of power, it takes 10 MJ ÷ 300 kW = 33.333 seconds to scan one chunk. This is done in an area of 29×29 chunks around the radar, excluding the nearby 7×7 chunks. With a total number of 792 chunks (29×29 − 7×7), it takes one radar 7 hours 20 minutes to complete one full scan cycle. If everything is already explored it continues to scan by re-scanning the longest-ago scanned chunk within range. Multiple radars will share long-range chunks, reducing the amount of time it takes to complete long-range survey scanning. This is a smart process, meaning that the radars will not scan chunks currently being scanned by other radars. It is possible that a new alien nest will appear in a previously scanned chunk; just because you don't see it on the map, doesn't mean it is not there. Coverage Radars grant sight of a square area around them, which is displayed brighter than the rest of the map. This allows the player to zoom into the normal world view from the map and makes interaction with blueprints and deconstruction planners possible. The coverage area of a radar and the player. Charting If a chunk is scanned by a radar or player, the image of that chunk that is copied into the map of the players of this surface force (every force has its own map). This procedure is called \"charting\". Animation of chunks in the upper-right area being revealed by radars. Charting process If the contents of a chunk changes between two ticks, the content of that chunk is \"charted\" into the map. The map is just a bitmap, a picture. You can see the entities moving, you can see enemies walking. Every entity is represented by one or more pixels. Not every entity is drawn. Users can recognize what is drawn because of the color. Charting of several chunks that change each tick might have an impact on game performance, manifesting in the form of lowered UPS or FPS . Charting decay time / fog of war Once a scan for a chunk is triggered, it keeps actively charted for 10 seconds . This effect can also be seen in the map of the chunk highlighted and dims within 10 seconds to a greyed out version of the chunk. If charting is not repeated within the 10 seconds, the charting process stops for this chunk after 10 seconds and is no longer updated. What you see after that time is the last charted picture for that chunk (also called \"fog of war\"). Charting of vehicles Even in the fog of war you can see the last charted position of vehicles. Trains last positions are not charted, because they normally move after the charting stops. Vehicles are shown as a circle, with an arrow pointing in the direction that they're facing. Remote control Tanks and spidertrons cannot be entered when out of radar range, but can still be controlled and exited. Invisible (black) parts of the map The map generator creates a \"border\" of invisible chunks around each chunk, that becomes active at some time. Active chunks are those that become charted or those that are active because the pollution spreads onto them. Circuit network Every radar has a circuit network connection to every other radar on that surface. Any circuit signal sent into a radar is output from every other radar on the surface. When the radar loses power, it loses its circuit connection. The output signal can only be seen in connected objects like electric poles, because the radar does not have a GUI.

They use magazines for ammunition which can be refilled manually or by inserters . Unlike laser turrets , they do not require power and can operate practically anywhere as long as they have sufficient ammunition. On the downside, this means that ammo must be periodically replenished. The gun turret has the same fire rate as the human-portable submachine gun . Physical projectile damage (research) upgrades both the base damage of the ammunition and the damage of the turret as two separate, multiplicative bonuses, quickly leading to a much higher damage output than the SMG. Inserters can insert and remove magazines from gun turrets. This allows chaining multiple turrets together with inserters, each inserter taking ammo, as needed, from one turret and placing it into the next. Inserters will only insert up to 10 magazines per turret. On Gleba , wrigglers are quite vulnerable to gun turrets, as they act like biters without the resistances. However, strafers can outrange the turrets, and are quite durable as they have small resistance to physical damage. Stompers negate more than half of received damage. Combined with their high health pool, gun turrets are not the best choice against them. On Vulcanus , the demolisher can have its segments damaged by the turrets, allowing large turret blocks to be effective against the small and even medium variants. Gallery A rotating turret.

Each shot costs 800kJ of energy; as the shooting speed increases through upgrades, so does the power required to keep firing. Using laser turrets to ward off attacks can cause electricity usage spikes, these can be offset by using accumulators (or steam storage and excess steam turbines ). On space platforms , lasers can be effective against small asteroids , which have only 20% laser resistance and 100 health. Other asteroids have laser resistance of 90% or more, making lasers relatively useless against them. Large groups of high quality lasers (which have extended range, not damage) can be useful against medium asteroids if they also have enough damage upgrades. Pentapods on Gleba have high laser resistance (50% for wrigglers, strafers, and egg rafts, 80% for stompers) so laser turrets are ineffective against them.

Area of effect size applies to igniting objects and contact damage. Flamethrower turrets work similarly to the flamethrower , setting enemies and the ground on fire and doing damage over time. Unlike gun turrets and laser turrets , they have a limited firing arc, and should therefore be placed at choke points or behind walls . They can use crude , heavy , or light oil as ammunition, which must be provided via a pipe connected to the turret. Contents 1 Mechanics 1.1 Fire resistance 2 History 3 See also Mechanics Flamethrower turrets gain a damage bonus depending on the type of oil supplied to them. This bonus is multiplicative, it stacks with the bonus damage from research. Ammunition Effect Crude oil 100% Damage Heavy oil 105% Damage Light oil 110% Damage Unlike the laser and gun turrets, flamethrower turrets do not have a instantaneously hitting projectile, instead firing a stream of flame directly at where the target was at the time of firing. This means that they have a tendency to miss the targeted biter in an attacking group, instead hitting the ones behind. Flamethrower turrets are very powerful because biters and spitters do not have fire resistance and the total 3000 damage dealt to ignited enemies is a guaranteed death sentence for almost anything in the game. An enemy unit is ignited if it is hit directly by a flame stream. Flamethrower turrets will target the closest non ignited enemy and then once all enemies within range are ignited they will target the closest enemy. The bonus technologies and fuel damage bonus for the flamethrower turret improve the contact damage and damage dealt by fire on the ground. The bonus technologies also affect the damage dealt to ignited enemies, which lasts 30 seconds and deals 100 damage per second without upgrades. While it is not apparent from the damage bonus descriptions, the flamethrower turret benefits from the damage bonus for the flamethrower turret and the damage bonus for flamethrower ammo, applied multiplicatively, e.g. with the first level of refined flammables it receives a +44% bonus, not +20%, with all pre-space upgrades it receives +576% damage, not +160%. This is because the flamethrower turret is defined as using \"flamethrower\" type ammo and it allows the damage output of the flamethrower turret to keep up with laser and gun turrets, which also benefit from two or more separate upgrades. Flamethrower turrets create fire on the ground which lasts 2 seconds by default. If the turret keeps firing at that spot, the size of the fire increases, it will last up to 30 seconds and its damage is increased up to 6 times, depending on how long the turret keeps firing at that spot. Multiple flamethrower turrets firing at the same location do not cause the fire to intensify faster as there is a 4 tick cooldown between intensity increases, while even a single flamethrower turret fires every 2 ticks. An object will be damaged by all the fire patches it is contacting potentially multiplying the damage from the fire several times. Fire resistance At a glance it's not easy to see how fire resistance is applied to flamethrower damage, as this requires knowing precisely how the damage is applied. Direct splash damage: Deals 3 damage 30 times a second. Fire sticker: Deals 16.67 damage 6 times a second. Fire patch: Deals 13 damage 6 times a second when fully intensified. These damages are increased by the refined flammables tech and liquid damage bonus. Spawners and larger worms have 3 flat fire resist, which mostly negates the direct splash damage but not the damage from intensified fire patches. Tanks, trains and spidertrons have 15 flat fire resist which negates the direct damage, at low levels of refined flammables this also mostly negates the damage from fire patches, but at higher levels these vehicles become very vulnerable to the flames, becoming particularly vulnerable at around refined flammables 4 when the fire patches are inflicting 46.9 damage of which only a third is negated by the flat fire resist. In Space Age , flamethrowers are considered burner devices and therefore cannot be placed on space platforms . Even if they could be placed, asteroids have 100% fire damage resistance. Pentapods on Gleba have no damage resistances to flamethrowers. While flamethrower turrets are not hitscan, they can still do sizeable damage to even the larger pentapods enemies. As on Nauvis, they are particularly effective against large groups of enemies. The demolishers on Vulcanus have 100% fire resistance.

It fires artillery shells , relatively slow-moving projectiles that explore chunks of terrain they travel across. The turret has both automatic and manual (even longer-ranged) firing modes. Projectiles have sufficient damage to destroy any type of worm up to behemoths with a single hit, and have a modest area of effect. They can also one-shot spawners up to just below 75% evolution, since spawner health increases with evolution. Infinitely-stacking research upgrades are available for range, firing speed, and (in Space Age ) damage. The artillery wagon is essentially the same weapon, only mounted on a train car and therefore mobile. Inserters can insert and remove artillery shells from artillery turrets. This allows chaining multiple turrets together with inserters, each inserter taking shells as needed, from one turret and placing it into the next. The artillery turret can be connected to the circuit network to read its current ammunition and/or enable it on a condition. Contents 1 Mechanics 2 Limitations 3 Achievements 4 Gallery 5 History 6 See also Mechanics Artillery turrets have a massive range, outranging other fixed fortifications by a factor of 10 or more. There are no special limits on how many may be built or where and, being ammunition-based, these turrets do not require electric power to operate. In automatic mode, they function much the same as other turrets, automatically scanning for valid targets within range and firing on them. Automatic mode can only target enemy structures (spawners and worms), not mobile units (biters and spitters), but everything within the shell's blast radius will take the same damage. Automatic mode can be disabled by opening the GUI of the artillery turret and toggling the \"Auto targeting\" box. In manual mode, an artillery targeting remote is used to point-and-click anywhere in the world, map, or zoomed-in map. Each click corresponds to one shell delivered to that location, so long as any working artillery turrets and / or wagons are in range. Targeting remotes show the number of fire-ready (loaded and, for wagons, stationary) artillery pieces in range of cursor position when held. Manual fire can be ordered on unexplored areas; shells will explore all chunks they travel across (but no surrounding chunks). The default range in automatic mode is 224 tiles (7 chunks); in manual mode, 560 tiles (17.5 chunks). Infinite research is available to increase range, at +30% of base range per level, applied to both automatic and manual range. Artillery turrets are capable of killing most enemies with a single shot, although behemoth worms and spawners with enough extra health from the planet's evolution factor take two shots to kill instead. Damage can be increased with infinite artillery damage research to combat this. The table below shows the maximum evolution factor at which spawners can be killed in one shot for the listed damage research level. Artillery damage research Biter / spitter spawners Egg rafts Notes 0 <= 0.72 <= 0.52 All non-behemoth worms can be killed in one shot 1 0.76 0.57 2 0.80 0.60 3 0.83 0.64 4 0.86 0.67 5 0.89 0.70 6 0.92 0.73 7 0.95 0.76 8 0.97 0.78 Behemoth worms can be killed in one shot 9 1.0 0.80 ... 20 1.0 1.0 Limitations Aside from the considerable expense of research and assembly for both turrets and shells, there are certain considerations that make a base defense based purely on these turrets unwise, despite their phenomenal range. Artillery shelling will antagonize enemy mobile units in the vicinity of the impact into rushing the turret emplacement, regardless of their normal \"aggro radius\". Artillery turrets are relatively slow-firing, although infinite research is available to improve firing speed, at +100% per level, affecting both stationary turrets and wagons and applying to both automatic and manual mode. They also cannot target mobile units in automatic mode. Importantly, artillery has a minimum range as well, which is 32 tiles. Together, these limitations mean that an artillery turret needs to be defended by other means. Any conventional approach such as walls, gun, laser, and / or flamethrower turrets, or the personal intervention of the player will do. However, players should keep in mind that extensive shelling of large biter-infested areas will produce massive attack waves centered on the position of the artillery piece at time of firing, and should plan close-range defenses accordingly. Logistic considerations are also important, as artillery shells have a stack size of 1, meaning any-size container can only hold a modest supply and an inserter will only ever move a single shell at a time. Players may wish to consider on-site assembly for permanent and semi-permanent emplacements. The turret itself can hold 15 shells, and the wagon version can hold a full 100, providing a buffer of some size when continuous supply is not available. Artillery wagons with auto targeting disabled can be used to transport artillery shells to regular turret outposts, since they can hold twice as many shells as a cargo wagon.

You can help this wiki by expanding it . Space Age expansion exclusive feature. The rocket turret is a powerful defensive building capable of firing rockets and explosive rockets at high range. It is unlocked with agricultural science packs which can be crafted on Gleba . The rocket turret has a minimum range, so it is best paired with other turrets that can pick off enemies who get too close. Its high range and damage make it particularly effective against large asteroids in space and stompers on Gleba. The turrets rotational speed is fairly slow. Rocket turrets can fire all kinds of rocket ammo, including atomic bombs and capture bot rockets . However, when firing atomic bombs, rocket turrets do not get the usual range increase that the hand-held rocket launcher or spidertrons get. This means the turret will be very close to or inside of the blast radius. When firing capture bot rockets, a rocket turret will exclusively target biter and spitter spawners , overriding any target priorities it may have. However, if a rocket turret empty on ammo is targeting a non-spawner enemy when it is loaded with capture rockets, then its first shot will fire on that enemy, wasting the capture bot rocket. To one-shot big asteroids (except for promethium asteroids) with standard rockets , stronger explosives (research) level 23 is required. History 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

The tesla turret is a powerful turret which deals electric damage capable of hitting multiple enemies at once. \nThe tesla turret fires an electric bolt that can bounce to secondary enemies in an arcing chain. Hits temporarily stun enemies, slowing them down, which works well in combination with other turrets. Unlike the handheld tesla gun , the tesla turret does not require tesla ammo . It only needs electricity to operate. It consumes 1 MW continuously. Each shot consumes 12 MJ of energy, so when firing at full speed, the turret pulls a total of 7 MW. These can be offset by using accumulators (or steam storage and excess steam turbines ). Many larger enemies are segmented (demolishers, stompers and strafers); this means that they have different target entities that share a single pool of hit points. The tesla turret can be particularly effective against such enemies, as a single electric bolt can bounce between different segments of the same enemy. The tesla turret is ineffective against asteroids as they all have 100% electric resistance . History 2.0.7 : Introduced in Space Age expansion.

    "title": "Factorio:Wiki rules",
    "content": "Below are the community guidelines for the Official Factorio Wiki. Infringing upon any of these rules will result in either a warning or a temporary/permanent ban, depending on the circumstances. These rules are not final, and are subject to change. Additionally, all admins hold the right to enforce as they see fit, even if the rule they enforce is not specifically enumerated here. We at the Official Factorio Wiki thank you for your cooperation, and we hope that you see these rules as fair and acceptable. Of course, you may message an admin at any time to discuss the rules or ask for clarification. Our rules are fairly standard to what you'd find on other wikis. Contents 1 Discipline 2 Conduct 3 Editing 4 Page creation 4.1 Templates and redirects 5 Requesting admin work, Misc 6 See also Discipline Before getting into the list of rules, the process that the Wiki administration team takes will be explained here. We follow a very simple system, which progresses from a polite unofficial warning to a permanent ban, depending on the severity and times that the event has occurred. Their violation will also be undone. There are a few 'shortcut' rules that if broken will skip stages, however. An unofficial warning - The user will be sent a kind message pointing out that they did something incorrect, and that's it. The violation will be fixed by an admin. An official warning - The user will be sent a kind message stating that they have been officially warned to cease what they're doing. It will use the phrase \"This is an official warning.\" A temporary ban - The user will be temporarily banned from the Wiki, for a variable amount of time, depending on the case. They will also be sent a message. A permanent ban - The user will be given a permanent ban, and a message. If the user goes some time between violations, the stages will undo back to 2. However, certain violations result in an immediate ban, such as vandalism, spamming external site links, attempting to mess with the mediawiki installation, etc. These are further detailed below. Conduct Be respectful to all editors, and readers. All forms of hate are not tolerated , and will result in an official warning directly. All forms of vandalism and spam are not tolerated , and violators will be banned without question. Wiki talk pages are for discussion of their respective page only . Please keep all discussion of in-game mechanics to the forums or subreddit, the links to which are in the sidebar. An article's talk page is intended for discussion or questions regarding the article's content. It is not a forum for casual discussion. Game suggestions, personal stories, shout-outs, etc. will be removed. Similarly, self/other promotional content is forbidden unless it is for specific examples and educational purposes . Edits made that simply show off or enumerate user creations will be removed. Always remain civil during discussions. Registered users are expected to use a single account for all editing under most circumstances. The use of more than one account by a single individual is known as \"sockpuppeting\", and is a very high offense. A second account can be used in certain rare circumstances by longtime established, trusted users. Some valid reasons to use a second account may include those below. In those cases, it must be made absolutely clear that the accounts are operated by the same individual. Technical testing Bot (automated) accounts Administrators who want to use non-admin accounts in less secure editing situations. Editing Do not edit-war. If a user overwrites your change and you disagree, do not edit the page back and forth, discuss it on the talk page of the page in question. In instances of edit warring, the oldest version is preferred until a decision is reached. Moving a page back and forth and un-deleting a page without permission is also considered edit warring. This ties into the above rule, but assume good faith. If a wiki editor makes a mistake due to human error, the fact that they are new to the community, or any other honest reason, fellow wiki community members must assume good faith. Rather than insulting, berating, or lashing out at the editor, community members should approach situations like these with a helpful and understanding attitude. This is why unofficial warnings are given first. Refrain from using profanity unless it is used within a direct quotation. Preferably, censor the curse with stars. Refrain from editing other users' user pages, unless it is to remove broken links. While the Wiki can be easily reverted in the event of a mistake, please try to avoid creating work for others. Mod related documentation is not to be hosted on this wiki. The Official Factorio Wiki is meant for documentation of the base game only. Instead, users looking for documentation or developers looking to provide documentation should do so on their mod's entry in the mod portal, or bundle the documentation with the source code of the mod. This wiki does not document nor enumerate mods. Tying into the above rule, the Wiki also does not enumerate user creations. User creations should only be placed on the Wiki for demonstration and educational purposes only, simply enumerating or showing off designs will be removed as there exist better portals for this. Pages with high amounts of transclusions/importance will be protected, to both protect against vandalism, and to protect the servers from load caused by edits to these pages. Contact an admin if you want a change one of these pages or feel like it should not be protected. Page creation Work in progress pages of new content must be created in the author's userspace. Any other language has no right to obtain a page name which collides with English. There exist a few words that are the same in multiple languages (The word 'So' means the same in English and in German, for example), these words cannot be used for page names to avoid collisions. No other language has the right to use a page name which means the same or something different in another language. This is also to prevent confusion. Language pages when translated should use the English name with the language code appended to the end of the name. For example, \"Transport belt\" when translated to German should be named \"Transport belt/de\". Please note that any languages that are not listed here are not reachable when translated (won't show up as a language the page is in). Please ask an admin to add support for a new language you wish to translate to. The wiki tries to use the same language codes as the game, with a few legacy exceptions. See also: Translation guide Page names should only be capitalized at the first word, with some exceptions. Essentially, Petroleum gas, and not Petroleum Gas. This is both for readability and for the internal code of the wiki to work correctly. Failing to do this will result in the page's name being fixed. Translation of WIP pages or pages in someone's userspace is highly discouraged. While it won't be stopped, it is very likely to result in a waste of effort, since the page may never reach the public eye, or be finished. Pages may only be created in the user's userspace if they are meant to end up on the general wiki or otherwise relevant to the wiki (sandboxes, etcetera). If the page is not related to the wiki, it has to be related to Factorio, and may not be linked from outside sources, including the general wiki. Uploading files for a non-wiki-related page is not permitted. Templates and redirects Redirects may only be created in the following circumstances: The redirect is being used to fix several similar red links, and it would be too much effort to correct them in other ways. The redirect is being used to 'autocorrect' a common mistake, such as not prefixing a tutorial with Tutorial: . This does not include spelling mistakes! The redirect is being used to fix an incorrect external link that occurs on many sites. If the incorrect link only occurs on one site, have the owner of that site fix it. The redirect is to a file, to fix several file based red links or broken icons. The redirect is created automatically by a page move. Redirects may NOT be created under the following circumstances: To redirect on a common community slang (e.g Underneathies -> Underground belts). People are smart enough to search for the actual in-game name. To solve a small amount of red links. Where possible, fix the red links directly. To fix small issues such as incorrect capitalization, etc. There is a search feature on the Wiki. Redirects may not be created unless there is actually a lot of links going to them. Redirects created with the idea of \"This might be useful someday\" are noise and provide nothing. Again, there is a search function. There are rare exceptions to this rule, stated above. Redirects may not exist within user spaces, except when a page was moved and the redirect was created by that page move. Any other redirects created or placed into a user's userspace will be deleted. Templates may be created in the following circumstances: The creating user has permission from an admin to create the template and use it on pages. Often, we may have an easier method of solving the problem the editor is attempting to fix with a template, but is unaware we have it. Ask us, we don't bite. It is acceptable to create a template inside of your userspace, for use with testing another WIP page. However, you may NOT use this template anywhere but within your userspace. Upon approval, you may create the template, or move it out of your userspace, but not before. Why we discourage the use of templates: Templates are a powerful feature, so much so that users often attempt to fix problems with them. However, to put it to an analogy, using a template to fix a small problem is like using a backhoe to weed your garden. Most of the time, it is overkill and provides no clarity or convenience that could not be provided via other means. Templates are inefficient, and require many resources from the server to resolve them when a lot of them are put onto a page. This can put load onto Wube's servers, which we try to avoid. Templates make it harder to understand pages. Since they can create text arbitrarily, it can be difficult to determine which of the many templates on a page is creating text that shows up on save. It is better to have less templates, so it is easier for editors to understand the construction of a page. Requesting admin work, Misc There exists a few templates for this purpose, mainly {{Delete}}, {{Move}}, and {{Merge}}. These may be placed on pages to request action be taken by moderators or by editors. However, do note that the request may be denied. Files that are unused are always up for deletion, so ensure that any images uploaded are immediately used somewhere on the Wiki.

    "content": "This is the official Factorio style guide. Please follow this guide and the rules when creating or editing pages and files on this wiki. Unlike the rules, failure to follow this guide will not be punished, however it is still highly encouraged to follow it. Contents 1 Page creation and upcoming/outdated content 2 Language 3 Page layout and formatting 3.1 Capitalization 3.2 The history section 4 Media 4.1 Taking screenshots of the game 5 Templates 6 See also Page creation and upcoming/outdated content Avoid creating unnecessary pages or subpages. If the info you are trying to add is related to an entity in-game, please place the info on that entity's page. See the Editor noticeboard for guidelines on whether the wiki is currently targeting the stable or experimental version of the game. Upcoming features should be referenced with a link to a comment or image posted by a member of Factorio's development staff. Please consider that the Factorio Friday Facts usually show plans and not confirmed changes, so information should not be treated as such. Pages about removed content should be marked with the {{archive}} template and not be edited any further, except to remove redlinks or outdated categories. Language Edit in an “encyclopedia” style, avoiding use of the first person or any personal bias. Avoid words like I, me, you, etc. The tutorial namespace is exempt from this guideline. Correct all typos found, even if changing the sentence layout is necessary. Comprehension is important. Use the \"Show preview\" button to view your changes before saving them, to allow yourself to catch incorrect links and typos, and improper formatting. While creating multiple edits to the same page is allowed, it creates clutter on the recent changes screen and in the page history. The default language is American English, however English pages may also use European English. All pages must have an English version, and should be translated English -> Other. Use of country-specific slang must be avoided. Only translate pages if you fluently speak the language you are translating to. Items, entities, and other in-game objects should be named and translated according to the official in-game translations. To automatically translate page names, infoboxes and similar templates, use Template:Translation . See also the translation guide . Page layout and formatting Typically, a page will start with a short intro, then the content of the page, a history section, and a \"see also\" section. Please follow this when creating content pages. Categories should be used sparingly. Please use sane formatting, and do not Capitalize Words Like This, or L I K E T H I S. Do not overuse bold , italics , or colorful text. This detracts from the effect of said text when it is actually necessary. Usually [[iron gear wheel]]s is preferred over the piped version which would be [[iron gear wheel|iron gear wheels]] . Any text can be placed immediately after a link to become part of the link. Do not create circular links, i.e. do not link a page to itself. This also means that a page should not link to a redirect that links to the page itself. If making a comment to other editors is necessary, place the comment in comment delimiters, <!-- Comment --> so it cannot be seen by users. This can be necessary to explain the page's specific formatting, such as seen on the news page. The first instance of the page title should be bold . This should usually be in the first sentence of the article. No other instance of the page title should be bold. For info on how to bold words, see the help page on formatting . The first instance of an item name on a page can be linked, via double brackets (eg. [[copper plate]] ). Further mentions of the same item should generally only be re-linked if the second link is more than a page-length away from the original. Capitalization Only the first letter should be capitalized in section headings or page names. Proper nouns such as planet names (\"Nauvis\", \"Gleba\", ...) and the names of the expansion mods (\"Space Age\", \"Quality\", \"Elevated Rails\") should be capitalized. However, the content they contain (quality tiers, elevated rail entity, etc.) should not be capitalized. In-game items, entities, and other in-game object names are common nouns and should not be capitalized unless they start a new sentence. When linking to another page within a flowing text, use normal capitalization for the link. For example: \"in order to craft [[iron gear wheel]]s, [[iron plate]]s must...\" and not \"in order to craft [[Iron gear wheel]]s, [[Iron plate]]s must... . Remember that the first letter is automatically capitalized to resolve the page when the link is clicked. The history section This wiki uses a history section on all content pages to track when entities/items are changed in the game. To do this, the wiki uses the history template, which provides automatic formatting and version linking. The header for this section should be == History == . Bugs and bug fixes must not be placed in the update history section of a page. Any kind of bug should be reported on the forums and has no place on the wiki unless it is deemed \"not a bug\" by the developers. In that case, the specific behavior should be documented on the page itself and not in its history section. However, bug fixes are documented on version history pages, since they are part of the official changelog. While a history section is not required for information pages such as Railway , all content pages concerning entities or mechanics of the game should have a history, taken from the changelog file provided with a standard Factorio install. The history template will automatically link to the relevant page in version history . Trivia and general facts are allowed, as long as it does not contain personal opinion or conjecture. These facts should be placed in a specific \"Trivia\" section. If possible, (such as detailing information provided by a dev through official channels) provide a source link. The history section should not be included in translated pages. Likewise, the version history is not to be translated. See the translation guide for further information. Media When possible, avoid putting important text in images, as it is not search-able, and makes finding that info harder. The text also can not be translated, so each language would need its own version of the image. If a translated version of an image is needed, please upload it under the same name as the original image, with your language suffix at the end, e.g. (Programmable_speaker_ui.png in German -> Programmable_speaker_ui-de.png) When uploading an image, please use a descriptive, unique name. Images given a non-descriptive name will be renamed. Item icons should be named after their English in-game name. When uploading an updated version of an image, use the \"upload a new version of this image\" link found on the old file's page. This ensures that all old instances are updated automatically. Please mark any duplicated files for deletion by placing the deletion template on the page: {{delete}} . If uploading images that are not of Factorio, please ensure you hold rights to upload the image. Gifs of mechanics are allowed and encouraged. Please ensure that the image you are uploading is of good quality. Use the PNG filetype when possible. All in-game sprites/icons that were retrieved directly from the game source files need to have Template:Game image on their file page. This is essential to indicate that you do not own the copyrights of the image. Taking screenshots of the game Place {{Screenshot}} in the file description when uploading it. Take pictures at day! Use night or dawn only if you need to explain something that only works at night (for example, the lights). Turn off clouds, smoke and animated trees! The shadows distract from the actual content of the image. Reset brightness, contrast and saturation to default in the graphics settings. In Space Age , try to take screenshot of entities on their respective planets/space platforms and otherwise prefer taking screenshots on Nauvis if possible. Turn on ALT mode. Use god mode or the map editor ! You can move anywhere on the map and your character won't be in the picture. It is possible to take large screenshots using a console command .  For example: /c game.take_screenshot{{x=1024, y=1024}, showgui=false, show_entity_info=true, zoom=2}  takes pixel perfect screenshots with the new high resolution graphics. You can slow down the game or pause the game in the map editor to find the right moment for the picture. Go into the highest zoom level you possibly can without missing any vital information. A good in-game picture should be built so that only the relevant entities/items are shown. Anything in the photo other than what you are trying to show/explain is unnecessary clutter. Crop pictures to show only what you want to show. Try to make a picture without the character unless the character is the subject of the screenshot. Don't use .jpg / .jpeg as a fileformat as you will lose detail. Use the high resolution sprites! For images to be used in an infobox: Use zoom level 2. Try to make the image 300×300px in size, or at least square. Prefer a natural background like desert or grass over lab tiles. Templates Templates are to be used for formatting/common text on many pages. Do not create templates for only a few pages, except for special circumstances. Templates should be have their use described using Template:Documentation by including it in the template code: <noinclude>{{doc}}</noinclude> Avoid making many sequential edits to a commonly used template.

    "content": "This is the official editor noticeboard for the Factorio wiki. This is a general dispatcher page that editors seeking information about what to do or the state of the wiki can check. This wiki is the work of a team. The goal is for people to add information or bring it into better context, create images, or design the layout of the pages, with the end goal to provide an easy place for beginners to Factorio to gain information. The team communicates through the talk-pages (\"Discussion\" tab at the top) or through the forum . It's very important to check recent changes (\"View History\" tab at the top of the page). History will show you all the changes people have made to the page. Additionally, checking \"Recent Changes\" on the sidebar is also recommended. You can change the shown results in  preferences! If you need to contact an admin, the following admin is currently active: Bilka ( talk ) Editor announcements The wiki is being updated to 2.0. We are always targeting the latest experimental version. Links to monitor These are links that should be checked over to ensure nothing strange is going on. Pages with broken file links -- There are a few pages here that are here out of necessity (mainly templates and some sandboxes), ensure no new pages or existing main namespace pages pop up. Broken redirects -- Should only contain pages that are not yet translated, any pages that do not already exist in English should be removed Double redirects -- Must always stay empty. In the event of A>B>C, make A>C directly. Unused files -- Ensure no new files appear here (from your perspective, some may be used in the future) and mark them for deletion. Wanted pages -- This page is updated periodically, check it if you're looking for pages to translate, or solving red links. Misc Recurring tasks These tasks are common maintenance and must be done repeatedly. Correction Read through the pages (of your language) and correct mistakes or bad language usage. Mistakes can include typos, outdated information, wrong information, bad formatting, etc. Special page checking Please be sure to look at special pages often, specifically ones concerning issues such as broken or double redirects, etc. Sorting out these problems makes the wiki more organized and sane. Translation Take an English page, copy the content into a sub-page with the language code (Eg /de for German) and translate it to your language. Please only translate if you speak the language very fluently or natively. Do note that stuff like infoboxes and navboxed automatically translate. If they automatically translate incorrectly, Edit the translation template for the language. (eg Template:Translation/de for German) See also: Translation guide Page design This is about the look and feel of this wiki. Deep knowledge of Mediawiki's template system is not really needed, but will help. For the beginning just try to understand how the current templates work. Make your own test-page in your user-space and try to program around. It can be really fun because this task is more or less like programming. If you need assistance, be sure to check the \"help\" link on the sidebar of the Wiki, as it can give lots of information about the markup of the Mediawiki language. Context A context specialist focuses on providing context. Creating links between pages, setting up Navboxes, marking old pages for archive/deletion, etc. Please do not make large changes without consulting an admin . Community interaction You may also field questions and assist other editors, or members of the greater community. If you are unsure, please refer the community member to an Admin.

    "content": "This is the official admin noticeboard for the Factorio wiki. This page details the current and recurring tasks that are being handled by the admin team and trusted users.

Files that were uploaded recently (around 1-2 weeks ago) can stay, but after that they can and should be deleted. Outdated images -- These images should be updated or merged with already updated images. Admin only Actions to clean up these categories should be done according to common sense. Some time in the future we should have a public policy on what do delete and what to keep etc, but for now only User:Bilka handles big deletions.

Naming: File:Flag_ suffix .png. Add the file to [[Category:Flags]]. Change the WantedPages script to sort by the new language instead of putting it in \"other\". Bot actions/pages These pages are updated every Friday when the FFF comes out, when there have been big changes to the pages they list, and when a user requests that they be updated. Currently, User:Bilka handles the backend of the bot performing these actions. News Factorio:Wanted pages Factorio:Redirects Factorio:Top pages The infoboxes are partially updated automatically, changes are shown as performed by User:BilkaBot . Item and recipe icons are also partially automated through the same bot. If you want to report an error with one of the changes, request another parameter to be automatically updated, or ask for an update of the values because the most recent Factorio version changed something, please contact one of the active admins. User:BilkaBot also automatically updates the version history subpages, Template:VersionNav and Main Page/Latest versions whenever a new version comes out. Current tasks Clean-up of redirects/less links going via redirects on normal pages Average priority (doesn't have to be done within in the next week, but should be done within a few weeks, up to months) Useful pages Factorio:Redirects ( Special:ListRedirects ) Delete a redirect/replace a redirect with a direct link on a page if: The redirect is used to correct casing (eg. Passive Provider Chest →‎ Passive provider chest), is a research URL without \"(research)\" (eg. Advanced electronics →‎ Advanced electronics (research)), or comes from an old name (e.g. Diesel locomotive →‎ Locomotive) and has 0 incoming links. The redirect has an url like \"Railway/Train station/Train stop\" (subpage (of a subpage)) and has 0 incoming links. Don't delete redirects that have 0 inbound links if: it redirects a word in a language to the right language page (eg. Baum → Tree/de). the redirect contains (achievement), these redirects aid users searching for a specific achievement name. Redirects are not a bad thing in themselves so we should not get rid of them completely (thus average priority). The aim is to rather clean up pages that link to a lot of redirects by using direct links to the right pages. This enforces the correct naming of pages, better overall style, and eliminates problems with translations due to them linking to the wrongly named pages, so the pages are created under the wrong name, so they have to be moved. A note on redirects such as Baum → Tree/de (a word in a language redirected to the right language page): These redirects are useful for searching in different languages than English. Without them, finding an item in a different language is significantly harder since the right name can only be found in the text of the page. However, directly linking to these redirects should be avoided since item names often change in translations. A note on the difference between trusted users and admins Trusted users are users who have additional rights on the wiki, such as the ability to delete pages. However, trusted users are not part of the moderation team, and should not discipline rule violations. They are free to undo or correct edits that are rule violations or to enforce the style guidelines, but anything outside of that (giving a user a warning etc) should be reserved to administrators.

    "content": "Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ore and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in a short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire. Join forces with other players in cooperative Multiplayer , create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends. Add mods to increase your enjoyment, from small tweaks and helper mods to complete game overhauls, Factorio's ground-up Modding support has allowed content creators from around the world to design interesting and innovative features. While the core gameplay is in the form of the freeplay scenario, there are a range of interesting challenges in the form of the Scenario pack, available as free DLC. If you don't find any maps or scenarios you enjoy, you can create your own with the in-game Map Editor, place down entities, enemies, and terrain in any way you like, and even add your own custom script to make for interesting gameplay.
